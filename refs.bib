The text emphasizes methods that are most commonly used in practical application, such as classical inferences for two- and three-way contingency tables, logistic regression, loglinear models, models for multinomial (nominal and ordinal) responses, and methods for repeated measurement and other forms of clustered, correlated response data. Chapter headings remain essentially with the exception of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric models. Other major changes include an expansion of clustered data, new research on analysis of data sets with robust variables, extensive discussions of ordinal data, more on interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the book. R and SAS are now showcased as the software of choice. An author web site with solutions, commentaries, software programs, and data sets is available"--},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

  abstract = {As the importance of pharmacometric analysis increases, more and more complex mathematical models are introduced and computational error resulting from computational instability starts to become a bottleneck in the analysis. We propose a preconditioning method for non-linear mixed effects models used in pharmacometric analyses to stabilise the computation of the variance-covariance matrix. Roughly speaking, the method reparameterises the model with a linear combination of the original model parameters so that the Hessian matrix of the likelihood of the reparameterised model becomes close to an identity matrix. This approach will reduce the influence of computational error, for example rounding error, to the final computational result. We present numerical experiments demonstrating that the stabilisation of the computation using the proposed method can recover failed variance-covariance matrix computations, and reveal non-identifiability of the model parameters.},

To treat VAP empirically, the American Thoracic Society currently recommends antibiotic therapy based on the patients' risk of colonisation by an organism with multidrug resistance.

  abstract = {First-order conditional estimation (FOCE) has been the most frequently used estimation method in NONMEM, a leading program for population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling. However, with growing data complexity, the performance of FOCE is challenged by long run time, convergence problem and model instability. In NONMEM 7, expectation-maximization (EM) estimation methods and FOCE with FAST option (FOCE FAST) were introduced. In this study, we compared the performance of FOCE, FOCE FAST, and two EM methods, namely importance sampling (IMP) and stochastic approximation expectation-maximization (SAEM), utilizing the rich pharmacokinetic data of oxfendazole and its two metabolites obtained from the first-in-human single ascending dose study in healthy adults. All methods yielded similar parameter estimates, but great differences were observed in parameter precision and modeling time. For simpler models (i.e., models of oxfendazole and/or oxfendazole sulfone), FOCE and FOCE FAST were more efficient than EM methods with shorter run time and comparable parameter precision. FOCE FAST was about two times faster than FOCE but it was prone to premature termination. For the most complex model (i.e., model of all three analytes, one of which having high level of data below quantification limit), FOCE failed to reliably assess parameter precision, while parameter precision obtained by IMP and SAEM was similar with SAEM being the faster method. IMP was more sensitive to model misspecification; without pre-systemic metabolism, IMP analysis failed to converge. With parallel computing introduced in NONMEM 7.2, modeling speed increased less than proportionally with the increase in the number of CPUs from 1 to 16.},

  abstract = {An in vitro culture technic for the study of reticulocyte maturation was described. The method gave reproducible results and proved to be of value in the comparative study of reticulocyte maturation in blood disorders. By this method it was shown that variations in the reticulocyte maturation in vitro paralleled similar variations present in vivo.The maturation of reticulocytes from patients with different types of anemia was investigated. In some anemias the in vitro maturation of reticulocytes was prolonged, not only because younger reticulocytes were present in the blood, but also because the rate at which the reticulum substance disappeared was delayed. This was particularly evident in the anemia of chronic uremia, in Cooley's anemia and in pernicious anemia in relapse. In only occasional cases of hereditary spherocytosis and of autoimmune hemolytic anemia was the rate of reticulocyte maturation found to be moderately delayed. In patients with iron deficiency anemia or bleeding anemia it was always normal.From the above findings the following conclusions were derived:1. The reticulocyte number in the circulating blood is the resultant of three variables: (a) the rate of output of new reticulocytes from the bone marrow; (b) the stage of maturation at which reticulocytes are delivered into the peripheral circulation; (c) the rate of disappearance of the reticulum substance.2. The number of reticulocytes in the circulating blood cannot be indiscriminately used as a precise index of red cell production in erythrokinetics.3. There is good reason to believe that a defect in the rate at which the reticulocytes mature in the circulating blood is an index of a similar defect in the process of erythroblastic differentiation in the bone marrow.},

Although a wide range of parametric and non-parametric methods for non-proportional hazards has been proposed, there is no consensus on the best approaches. To close this gap, we conducted a systematic literature search to identify statistical methods and software appropriate under non-proportional hazard. Our literature search identified 907 abstracts, out of which we included 211 articles, mostly methodological ones. Review articles and applications were less frequently identified. The articles discuss effect measures, effect estimation and regression approaches, hypothesis tests, and sample size calculation approaches, which are often tailored to specific non-proportional hazard situations. Using a unified notation, we provide an overview of methods available. Furthermore, we derive some guidance from the identified articles.},

  abstract = {Background Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is commonly recommended for use, due to its benefits on external validity, in randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). No published reports describe how ITT analysis, as well as alternative approaches, are used in anti-infective RCTs. The purpose of this study is to describe the extent to which ITT analysis and alternative data approaches are used, the practices used to handle missing subject data, and whether non-inferiority trials present both ITT and per protocol (PP) analyses. Results of this analysis will help guide end users of infectious diseases primary drug literature. Methods A cross-sectional study of RCTs of anti-infectives published from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 was conducted. A PubMed search identified relevant articles published in five specialty infectious diseases journals and four general medical journals. Each article was reviewed by two independent investigators with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify results. Results One hundred four articles met study criteria. The most common medication classes represented in the RCTs were hepatitis C antivirals (26~\%), antibacterials (25~\%), and antiretrovirals (21~\%). Thirty studies (29~\%) were non-inferiority trials. Most studies (77~\%) described use of ITT or modified ITT (mITT) in their methods. Of the ITT and mITT studies, most (73~\%) did not describe practices used to handle missing data. Most (97~\%) non-inferiority trials described use of ITT, mITT, or both; however, only 15 (50~\%) also described use of PP. Conclusions RCTs of anti-infectives commonly employ ITT and mITT. Most do not describe how missing data were addressed. Non-inferiority trials of anti-infectives do not consistently employ both ITT and PP populations.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Colistin plays a key role in treatment of serious infections by               Pseudomonas aeruginosa               . The aims of this study were to (i) identify the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index (i.e., the area under the unbound concentration-time curve to MIC ratio [{\textflorin}AUC/MIC], the unbound maximal concentration to MIC ratio [{\textflorin}               C               max               /MIC], or the cumulative percentage of a 24-h period that unbound concentrations exceed the MIC [{\textflorin}               T               {$>$}MIC               ]) that best predicts colistin efficacy and (ii) determine the values for the predictive PK/PD index required to achieve various magnitudes of killing effect. Studies were conducted in a one-compartment               in vitro               PK/PD model for 24 h using               P. aeruginosa               ATCC 27853, PAO1, and the multidrug-resistant mucoid clinical isolate 19056 muc. Six intermittent dosing intervals, with a range of {\textflorin}               C               max               colistin concentrations, and two continuous infusion regimens were examined. PK/PD indices varied from 0.06 to 18 for targeted {\textflorin}               C               max               /MIC, 0.36 to 312 for {\textflorin}AUC/MIC, and 0 to 100\% for {\textflorin}               T               {$>$}MIC               . A Hill-type model was fit to killing effect data, which were expressed as the log               10               ratio of the area under the CFU/ml curve for treated regimens versus control. With {\textflorin}               C               max               values equal to or above the MIC, rapid killing was observed following the first dose; substantial regrowth occurred by 24 h with most regimens. The overall killing effect was best correlated with {\textflorin}AUC/MIC (               R               2               = 0.931) compared to {\textflorin}               C               max               /MIC (               R               2               = 0.868) and {\textflorin}               T               {$>$}MIC               (               R               2               = 0.785). The magnitudes of {\textflorin}AUC/MIC required for 1- and 2-log               10               reductions in the area under the CFU/ml curve relative to growth control were 22.6 and 30.4, 27.1 and 35.7, and 5.04 and 6.81 for ATCC 27853, PAO1, and 19056 muc, respectively. The PK/PD targets identified will assist in designing optimal dosing strategies for colistin.},

For intravenous administration, colistin is dosed as its inactive prodrug colistin methanesulfonate (sodium), while polymyxin B is used as its sulfate (active antibacterial). Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in understanding their chemistry, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD). The first scientifically based dosing suggestions are now available for colistin methanesulfonate to generate a desired target steady-state plasma concentration of formed colistin in various categories of critically ill patients. As simply increasing polymyxin dosage regimens is not an option for optimizing their PK/PD due to nephrotoxicity, combination therapy with other antibiotics has great potential to maximize the efficacy of polymyxins while minimizing emergence of resistance. We must pursue rational approaches to the use of polymyxins and other existing antibiotics through the application of PK/PD principles.},

  abstract = {Informative diagnostic tools are vital to the development of useful mixed-effects models. The Visual Predictive Check (VPC) is a popular tool for evaluating the performance of population PK and PKPD models. Ideally, a VPC will diagnose both the fixed and random effects in a mixed-effects model. In many cases, this can be done by comparing different percentiles of the observed data to percentiles of simulated data, generally grouped together within bins of an independent variable. However, the diagnostic value of a VPC can be hampered by binning across a large variability in dose and/or influential covariates. VPCs can also be misleading if applied to data following adaptive designs such as dose adjustments. The prediction-corrected VPC (pcVPC) offers a solution to these problems while retaining the visual interpretation of the traditional VPC. In a pcVPC, the variability coming from binning across independent variables is removed by normalizing the observed and simulated dependent variable based on the typical population prediction for the median independent variable in the bin. The principal benefit with the pcVPC has been explored by application to both simulated and real examples of PK and PKPD models. The investigated examples demonstrate that pcVPCs have an enhanced ability to diagnose model misspecification especially with respect to random effects models in a range of situations. The pcVPC was in contrast to traditional VPCs shown to be readily applicable to data from studies with a priori and/or a posteriori dose adaptations.},

As few new efficacious antibiotics will become available in the near future, peptide antibiotics continue to be major therapeutic options for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Rational use of antibiotics requires optimisation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for the treatment of different types of infections. Toxicodynamics must also be considered to improve the safety of antibiotic use and, where appropriate, to guide therapeutic drug monitoring. This review focuses on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics/ toxicodynamics of peptide antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Optimising antibiotic exposure at the infection site is essential for improving their efficacy and minimising emergence of resistance.},

Nebulization seems to be a promising form of administration, but colistin is administered as an inactive prodrug, colistin methanesulfonate (CMS); however, differences between the intrapulmonary concentrations of the active moiety as a function of the route of administration in critically ill patients have not been precisely documented. In this study, CMS and colistin concentrations were measured on two separate occasions within the plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of critically ill patients (               n               = 12) who had received 2 million international units (MIU) of CMS by aerosol delivery and then intravenous administration. The pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using a population approach and completed by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling and simulations. The ELF colistin concentrations varied considerably (9.53 to 1,137 mg/liter), but they were much higher than those in plasma (0.15 to 0.73 mg/liter) after aerosol delivery but not after intravenous administration of CMS. Following CMS aerosol delivery, typically, 9\% of the CMS dose reached the ELF, and only 1.4\% was presystemically converted into colistin. PK-PD analysis concluded that there was much higher antimicrobial efficacy after CMS aerosol delivery than after intravenous administration. These new data seem to support the use of aerosol delivery of CMS for the treatment of pulmonary infections in critical care patients.},

In this paper, several types of metrics are defined: based on observations (standardized prediction error with or without simulation and normalized prediction distribution error); based on hyperparameters (with or without simulation); based on the likelihood of the model. All the metrics described above are applied to evaluate a model built from two phase II studies of gliclazide. A real phase I dataset and two datasets simulated with the real dataset design are used as external validation datasets to show and compare how metrics are able to detect and explain potential adequacies or inadequacies of the model. Results. Normalized prediction errors calculated without any approximation, and metrics based on hyperparameters or on objective function have good theoretical properties to be used for external model evaluation and showed satisfactory behaviour in the simulation study. Conclusions. For external model evaluation, prediction distribution errors are recommended when the aim is to use the model to simulate data. Metrics through hyperparameters should be preferred when the aim is to compare two populations and metrics based on the objective function are useful during the model building process.},

To examine the characteristics of `young'human red cells, we studied blood from seven healthy male volunteers who developed systemic reticulocytosis during a 3-week blood donation period. Each of these subjects donated a total of 6 units (450 ml/unit) of blood (2 units/week for 3 weeks) with subcutaneous recombinant erythropoietin (SC rEPO; 200 U/kg daily for 3 weeks). Two of these subjects were also studied with a similar protocol in the absence of rEPO (4 {$\cdot$} 5 {$\cdot$} 0 {$\cdot$} 5 units donated). SC rEPO administration was associated with an increased K content of the erythrocyte and with the appearance of hypochromic cells, which were initially normocytic and then became normochromic and microcytic. Measurements of cation transport revealed that, with the exception of the Na-K-Cl cotransport, all the systems studied increased their activities following blood donations with or without SC rEPO. The increase was highest in the K-Cl cotransport (2- and 5-fold for control and rEPO parts of the study, respectively), while the Na-K pump increased slightly in control and 40\% with rEPO. The Na-Li countertransport increased 40\% and 100\% in the control and rEPO parts of the study, respectively. Concomitant with increased ion transport activity, electron microscopic studies of plasma and red cells of subjects receiving SC rEPO showed the presence of circulating exosomes and cytoplasmic multivesicular bodies. The transferrin receptor was detected in the circulating exosomes, thereby providing evidence that, as do nonhuman red cells, maturing human reticulocytes shed exosome-associated transferrin receptors.},

  abstract = {Clear, polished, and stimulating presentations are as important to the scientific profession as they are to business, yet most scientists never receive formal training in the creation, delivery, and evaluation of such material. Compelling science communication is essential for PIs who must publish in high-quality journals, solicit funding, attract lab personnel, and impress colleagues. Likewise, students and post-docs must effectively communicate scientific ideas in order to publish, receive fellowships, network, and advance their careers. In spite of these facts, the scientific publishing market lacks an adequately visual guide to the production of effective presentations. Designing Science Presentations fills that gap and provides visually intensive guidance at every step-from the construction of original figures to the presentation and delivery of those figures in papers, slideshows, posters, and websites. This book provides pragmatic advice on the preparation and delivery of exceptional scientific presentations; demonstrates hundreds of visually striking presentation techniques, giving readers inspiration for creating their own; and is structured so that readers do not need to read from cover to cover to find an answer to a particular question. Clear heading for each section indicates its message, with graphic illustrations to highlight its 1-2 summary paragraphs that complement the visual images and clearly discuss the main point. Numerous examples of high-quality figures, page layouts, slides, posters, and web pages to help stimulate readers' ideas for their presentations. Numerous "before and after" examples so the reader can clearly see the contrast between poor and outstanding presentations},

  abstract = {There is increasing resistance to the oral antibiotics currently recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis, and increased healthcare costs are associated with the reliance on alternative intravenous agents. We, therefore, performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of oral antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis in adults. A search of four major medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase+ Embase classic, CENTRAL and Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews) in addition to manual reference searching of relevant reviews was conducted. Clinical cure and adverse event rates were reported, and trial quality and bias were assessed. A total of 277 studies were reviewed; five studies matched all eligibility criteria and were included. Antibiotics included were cefaclor, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, loracarbef, norfloxacin, rufloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In included studies, the clinical success of the outpatient treatment of pyelonephritis by cefaclor, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin at 4 to 6 weeks was comparable at between 83 to 95\%. Relatively high rates of adverse events were noted in a trial of ciprofloxacin (24\%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33\%). Significant heterogeneity between all aspects of the trial designs was identified, with all studies having a potential for bias. This review demonstrates a need for high-quality clinical trials into the oral antibiotic treatment of pyelonephritis, with more consistent designs and reporting of outcomes. There are data to support further research into oral norfloxacin and cefaclor for the outpatient treatment of pyelonephritis in adults.},

  abstract = {Abstract               Population pharmacokinetic analysis is used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters and their variability from concentration data. Due to data sparseness issues, available datasets often do not allow the estimation of all parameters of the suitable model. The PRIOR subroutine in NONMEM supports the estimation of some or all parameters with values from previous models, as an alternative to fixing them or adding data to the dataset. From a literature review, the best practices were compiled to provide a practical guidance for the use of the PRIOR subroutine in NONMEM. Thirty-three articles reported the use of the PRIOR subroutine in NONMEM, mostly in special populations. This approach allowed fast, stable and satisfying modelling. The guidance provides general advice on how to select the most appropriate reference model when there are several previous models available, and to implement and weight the selected parameter values in the PRIOR function. On the model built with PRIOR, the similarity of estimates with the ones of the reference model and the sensitivity of the model to the PRIOR values should be checked. Covariates could be implemented a priori (from the reference model) or a posteriori, only on parameters estimated without prior (search for new covariates).

  abstract = {Creatinine] was proved to change in the opposite direction of the kinetic GFR (GFRK), but does the [creatinine] also change in the opposite direction of the volume rate? If volume is administered and the [creatinine] actually goes up, then the two changes move in the same direction and their ratio is positive, paradoxically. The equation that describes [creatinine] as a function of time was differentiated with respect to the volume rate. This partial first derivative has a global maximum that can be positive under definable conditions. Knowing what makes the maximum positive informs when the derivative will be positive over some continuous domain of volume rate inputs. The first derivative versus volume rate curve has a maximum and a minimum point depending on the GFRK. If GFRK is below a calculable value, then the curve's minimum vanishes, letting it descend to - {$\infty$} and not allowing the derivative to ever be positive. If GFRK lies between a lower and a higher calculable value, then the curve's maximum vanishes, letting the derivative diverge to + {$\infty$}, though the clinical scenario is unrealistic. If GFRK is above the higher calculable value, then the curve's absolute maximum can become positive by decreasing the creatinine generation rate or increasing the initial [creatinine]. The derivative is potentially positive under these clinically realizable circumstances. The combination of parameters above can align in septic patients (low creatinine generation rate) with kidney failure (high initial [creatinine]) who are put on continuous dialysis (high GFRK). If a first derivative is positive, removing more volume can improve the [creatinine] and, dismayingly, giving more volume can worsen the [creatinine]. This paradox is explained by a covert interplay between the ambient [creatinine] and GFRK that excretes creatinine faster than its volume of distribution declines.},

  abstract = {Introduction: When the serum [creatinine] is changing, creatinine kinetics can still gauge the kidney function, and knowing the kinetic glomerular filtration rate (GFR) helps doctors take care of patients with renal failure. We wondered how the serum [creatinine] would respond if the kinetic GFR were tweaked. In every scenario, if the kinetic GFR decreased, the [creatinine] would increase, and vice versa. This opposing relationship was hypothesized to be universal. Methods: Serum [creatinine] and kinetic GFR, along with other parameters, are described by a differential equation. We differentiated [creatinine] with respect to kinetic GFR to test if the two variables would change oppositely of each other, throughout the gamut of all allowable clinical values. To remove the discontinuities in the derivative, limits were solved. Results: The derivative and its limits were comprehensively analyzed and proved to have a sign that is always negative, meaning that [creatinine] and kinetic GFR must indeed move in opposite directions. The derivative is bigger in absolute value at the higher end of the [creatinine] scale, where a small drop in the kinetic GFR can cause the [creatinine] to shoot upward, making acute kidney injury similar to chronic kidney disease in that regard. Conclusions: All else being equal, a change in the kinetic GFR obligates the [creatinine] to change in the opposite direction. This does not negate the fact that an increasing [creatinine] can be compatible with a rising kinetic GFR, due to differences in how the time variable is treated.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of adaptive design methods in clinical research and development based on accrued data has become very popular due to its flexibility and efficiency. Based on adaptations applied, adaptive designs can be classified into three categories: prospective, concurrent (ad hoc), and retrospective adaptive designs. An adaptive design allows modifications made to trial and/or statistical procedures of ongoing clinical trials. However, it is a concern that the actual patient population after the adaptations could deviate from the originally target patient population and consequently the overall type I error (to erroneously claim efficacy for an infective drug) rate may not be controlled. In addition, major adaptations of trial and/or statistical procedures of on-going trials may result in a totally different trial that is unable to address the scientific/medical questions the trial intends to answer. In this article, several commonly considered adaptive designs in clinical trials are reviewed. Impacts of ad hoc adaptations (protocol amendments), challenges in by design (prospective) adaptations, and obstacles of retrospective adaptations are described. Strategies for the use of adaptive design in clinical development of rare diseases are discussed. Some examples concerning the development of Velcade intended for multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are given. Practical issues that are commonly encountered when implementing adaptive design methods in clinical trials are also discussed.},

The creatinine `normal' tIl2(corresponding to a CI,, of 120 ml min-I) was also calculated. In the 10 patients studied, the observed CI,, ranged from 29.5 to 72.7 ml min-I. The corresponding calculated mean K was 0.076 f 0.028 h-I; R was 20.0 f 5.7 mg kg-' day-', and V was 0-60 f 0.1 I kg-I. The `normal' tlI2was 4.0 k 0.93 h. These pharmacokinetic parameters are consistent with those derived from radiotracer studies and other methods reported in the literature.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Polymyxins (colistin, polymyxin B) have been first-line antibiotics against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections. New anti-CRE antibiotics (ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, plazomicin) improve outcomes in CRE-infected patients and reduce toxicity compared with polymyxins. It is unclear how widely polymyxins and newer agents are used to treat CRE infections.                                         Methods               We conducted an online survey of US hospital-based pharmacists to determine antibiotic positioning against CRE infections. Numbers of all infections and CRE infections treated with different antibiotics in the United States were determined using IQVIA prescription data and Driving Re-investment in Research and Development and Responsible Antibiotic Use (DRIVE-AB) estimates of CRE infections.                                         Results               Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, or plazomicin were positioned as first-line agents against CRE pneumonia, bacteremia, intra-abdominal infections, and urinary tract infections at 87\%, 90\%, 83\%, and 56\% of surveyed US hospitals, respectively. From February 2018 to January 2019, an estimated 9437 and 7941 CRE infections were treated with an intravenous polymyxin or new agent, respectively; these figures represented {\textasciitilde}28\% (range, 19\%--50\%) and {\textasciitilde}23\% (range, 16\%--42\%) of CRE infections in the United States. Use of ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, or plazomicin exceeded that of intravenous polymyxins against CRE infections as of December 2018. Currently, the new drugs are estimated to treat 35\% (23\% to 62\%) of CRE infections in which they were expected to be first-line agents.                                         Conclusions               New anti-CRE agents recently surpassed intravenous polymyxins as treatment for CRE infections, but use is less than expected from their positioning at US hospitals. Research on behavioral and economic factors that impact use of new antibiotics is needed, as are financial ``pull'' incentives that promote an economically viable marketplace.},

  abstract = {We present an illness-death model for studying the incidence and the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. We argue that the illness-death model is better than a survival model for this purpose. In this model the best choice for the basic time-scale is age. Then we present extensions of this model for incorporating covariates and taking account of a possible e ect of calendar time. Calendar time is introduced via a proportional intensity model. We give the likelihood for a mixed discretecontinuous observation pattern from this model: clinical status is observed at discrete visit-times while the date of death is observed exactly or right-censored. The penalized likelihood approach allows to non-parametrically estimate the transition intensities. Application on the data of the Paquid study allows to produce estimates of the age-speci{\"y}c incidence of dementia together with mortality rates of both demented and non-demented subjects. Then the e ect of calendar time and educational level are studied. Low educational level increases the risk of dementia. The risk of dementia increases with calendar time while the mortality of demented subjects decreases. The most likely explanation of this result seems to be in a shift in the diagnosis of dementia towards earlier stages of the disease prompted by a change in the perception of dementia and the arrival of new drugs.

The relative rates of toxicity of polymyxin B and colistin have not been fully elucidated, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A retrospective cohort study of adults treated with polymyxin B or colistin for at least 48 h was conducted. The primary endpoint was the incidence of kidney injury assessed by RIFLE (i.e., risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage renal disease) criteria. Risk factors for kidney injury were evaluated using multivariate Cox regression. A total of 414 patients were evaluated, 220 of whom had CF. In patients without CF, there was no difference in kidney injury with polymyxin B and colistin (42.9\% versus 50.3\%, P ϭ 0.46). Loop diuretic exposure was a risk factor for kidney injury (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.82; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 2.83) in this population. In patients with CF, polymyxin B and colistin were associated with similar rates of kidney injury (34.5\% versus 29.8\%, P ϭ 0.77). Diabetes (aHR, 2.68; 95\% CI, 1.01 to 7.11), loop diuretics (aHR, 3.02; 95\% CI, 1.36 to 6.73), and progressive care unit admission (aHR, 8.21; 95\% CI, 2.55 to 26.46) were risk factors for kidney injury, while higher baseline serum creatinine levels (per 1 mg/dl) were protective (aHR, 0.08; 95\% CI, 0.01 to 0.48). Total unadjusted kidney injury in polymyxin-treated patients was less frequent in those who had CF (30.5\% versus 48.5\%, P Ͻ 0.001). Polymyxin B and colistin are associated with a high incidence of kidney injury; cystic fibrosis may be protective against polymyxin nephrotoxicity, but further investigation is needed to confirm this conjecture.},

  abstract = {Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of aminoglycosides has been a topic during the last thirty years. There is a tendency that - because of the once-daily regimen - TDM is considered not necessary anymore. Although once daily dosing has the potential for decreased toxicity, long-term usage can cause severe nephro- and ototoxicity. Furthermore, inadequate plasma concentrations can lead to treatment failure. This work is devoted to the development and application of the first mathematical model of aminoglycosides, which simulates in relation to the pharmacokinetics both their effects on bacteria as well as their nephrotoxicity and cochleotoxicity. Our software system is suitable for TDM. Based on theoretical considerations, a multi-compartment mathematical model in a numerical program in Matlab is derived that incorporates the antimicrobial effects of aminoglycosides, the saturable and active uptake into kidney cells, the reversible nephrotoxicity and the irreversible cochleotoxicity. Using fictitious person data, and an assumed pharmacokinetic and dynamic parameter set obtained from the literature, we simulated the drug concentrations, antibacterial effects, and toxicity over time in virtual patients to illustrate the benefits of optimized, efficacious dosage regimens that minimize (acceptable) nephro- and auditory ototoxicity. Our model confirms that extended-interval dosing seems the most appropriate to achieve this goal. By this manner, the present mathematical model contributes to an increase in our knowledge of how to obtain an optimized dosing strategy for individual patients. With the developed program, we are able to demonstrate that optimal aminoglycoside dosing still needs a sophisticated system of TDM.},

The need that led to its development, the impact of the method, and its pros and cons, along with available alternative approaches, are presented. Simulations explore its performance, using realistic parameters from a recent cardiovascular study.

The models are based on drug effects (inhibition or stimulation) on the factors controlling either the input or the dissipation of drug response. Pharmacokinetic parameters of methylprednisolone were used to generate plasma concentration and response-time profiles using computer simulations. It was found that the responses produced showed a slow onset and a slow return to baseline. The time of maximal response was dependent on the model and dose. In each case, hysteresis plots showed that drug concentrations preceded the response. When the responses were fitted with pharmacodynamic models based on distribution to a hypothetical effect compartment, the resulting parameters were dose-dependent and inferred biological implausibility. Indirect response models must be treated as distinct from conventional pharmacodynamic models which assume direct action of drugs. The assumptions, equations, and data patterns for the four basic indirect response models provide a starting point for evaluation of pharmacologic effects where the site of action precedes or follows the measured response variable.},

Here, we present a counterfactual framework and provide guidance to harmonize methodologies and optimize study quality. In AMR-burden studies, 2 counterfactual approaches have been applied: the harm of drug-resistant infections relative to the harm of the same drug-susceptible infections (the susceptible-infection counterfactual); and the total harm of drug-resistant infections relative to a situation where such infections were prevented (the no-infection counterfactual). We propose to use an intervention-based causal approach to determine the most appropriate counterfactual. We show that intervention scenarios, species of interest, and types of infections influence the choice of counterfactual. We recommend using purpose-designed cohort studies to apply this counterfactual framework, whereby the selection of cohorts (patients with drug-resistant, drug-susceptible infections, and those with no infection) should be based on matching on time to infection through exposure density sampling to avoid biased estimates. Application of survival methods is preferred, considering competing events. We conclude by advocating estimation of the burden of AMR by using the no-infection and susceptible-infection counterfactuals. The resulting numbers will provide policy-relevant information about the upper and lower bound of future interventions designed to control AMR. The counterfactuals should be applied in cohort studies, whereby selection of the unexposed cohorts should be based on exposure density sampling, applying methods avoiding time-dependent bias and confounding.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Static glomerular filtration rate formulas are not suitable for critically ill patients because of nonsteady state glomerular filtration rate and variation in the volume of distribution. Kinetic glomerular filtration rate formulas remain to be evaluated against a gold standard. We assessed the most accurate kinetic glomerular filtration rate formula as compared to iohexol clearance among patients with shock. DESIGN: Retrospective multicentric study. SETTING: Three French ICUs in tertiary teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Fifty-seven patients within the first 12 hours of shock. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On day 1, we compared kinetic glomerular filtration rate formulas with iohexol clearance, with or without creatinine concentration correction according to changes in volume of distribution and ideal body weight. We analyzed three static glomerular filtration rate formulas (Cockcroft and Gault, modification of diet in renal disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease--Epidemiology Collaboration), urinary creatinine clearance, and seven kinetic glomerular filtration rate formulas (Jelliffe, Chen, Chiou and Hsu, Moran and Myers, Yashiro, Seelhammer, and Brater). We evaluated 33 variants of these formulas after applying corrective factors. The bias ranged from 12 to 47 mL/min/1.73 m2. Only the Yashiro equation had a lower bias than urinary creatinine clearance before applying corrective factors (15 vs 20 mL/min/1.73 m2). The corrected Moran and Myers formula had the best mean bias, 12 mL/min/1.73 m2, but wide limits of agreement (--50 to 73). The corrected Moran and Myers value was within 30\% of iohexol-clearance--measured glomerular filtration rate for 27 patients (47.4\%) and was within 10\% for nine patients (15.8\%); other formulas showed even worse accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Kinetic glomerular filtration rate equations are not accurate enough for glomerular filtration rate estimation in the first hours of shock, when glomerular filtration rate is greatly decreased. They can both under- or overestimate glomerular filtration rate, with a trend to overestimation. Applying corrective factors to creatinine concentration or volume of distribution did not improve accuracy sufficiently to make these formulas reliable. Clinicians should not use kinetic glomerular filtration rate equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate in patients with shock.},

Methods.{$\quad$} This is a pre-planned analysis of a secondary outcome from a randomized, controlled trial comparing colistin monotherapy with colistin-meropenem combination for the treatment of severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant, colistinsusceptible Gram-negative bacteria. We evaluated rectal swabs taken on Day 7 or later for the presence of new colistin-resistant (ColR) isolates. We evaluated the emergence of any ColR isolate and the emergence of ColR Enterobacteriaceae (ColR-E). Results.{$\quad$} Data were available for 214 patients for the primary analysis; emergent ColR organisms were detected in 22 (10.3\%). No difference was observed between patients randomized to treatment with colistin monotherapy (10/106, 9.4\%) versus patients randomized to colistin-meropenem combination therapy (12/108, 11.1\%; P = .669).

Methods.{$\quad$} This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of patients with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections treated with colistin or colistin-meropenem combination. We evaluated patients with infection caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) identified as colistin susceptible (CoS) at the time of treatment and compared patients in which the isolate was confirmed as CoS with those whose isolates were retrospectively identified as colistin resistant (CoR) when tested by broth microdilution (BMD). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Results.{$\quad$} Data were available for 266 patients (214 CoS and 52 CoR isolates). Patients with CoR isolates had higher baseline functional capacity and lower rates of mechanical ventilation than patients with CoS isolates. All-cause 28-day mortality was 42.3\% (22/52) among patients with CoR strains and 52.8\% (113/214) among patients with CoS isolates (P = .174). After adjusting for variables associated with mortality, the mortality rate was lower among patients with CoR isolates (odds ratio [OR], 0.285 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, .118--.686]). This difference was associated with treatment arm: Mortality rates among patients with CoR isolates were higher in those randomized to colistin-meropenem combination therapy compared to colistin monotherapy (OR, 3.065 [95\% CI, 1.021--9.202]). Conclusions.{$\quad$} Colistin resistance determined by BMD was associated with lower mortality among patients with severe CRAB infections. Among patients with CoR isolates, colistin monotherapy was associated with a better outcome compared to colistin-meropenem combination therapy.},

  abstract = {Objective: To raise awareness among clinicians and epidemiologists that single-patient (n-of-1) trials are potentially useful for informing personalized treatment decisions for patients with chronic conditions. Study Design and Setting: We reviewed the clinical and statistical literature on methods and applications of single-patient trials and then critically evaluated the needs for further methodological developments. Results: Existing literature reports application of 2,154 single-patient trials in 108 studies for diverse clinical conditions; various recent commentaries advocate for wider application of such trials in clinical decision making. Preliminary evidence from several recent pilot acceptability studies suggests that single-patient trials have the potential for widespread acceptance by patients and clinicians as an effective modality for increasing the therapeutic precision. Bayesian and adaptive statistical methods hold promise for increasing the informational yield of single-patient trials while reducing participant burden, but are not widely used. Personalized applications of single-patient trials can be enhanced through further development and application of methodologies on adaptive trial design, stopping rules, network meta-analysis, washout methods, and methods for communicating trial findings to patients and clinicians. Conclusions: Single-patient trials may be poised to emerge as an important part of the methodological armamentarium for comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research. By permitting direct estimation of individual treatment effects, they can facilitate finely graded individualized care, enhance therapeutic precision, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs. {\'O} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Colistin is increasingly used as last-line therapy against Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) index that best correlates with the efficacy of colistin remains undefined. The activity of colistin against three strains of               Pseudomonas aeruginosa               was studied in neutropenic mouse thigh and lung infection models. The PKs of unbound colistin were determined from single-dose PK studies together with extensive plasma protein binding analyses. Dose-fractionation studies were conducted over 24 h with a dose range of 5 to 160 mg/kg of body weight/day. The bacterial burden in the thigh or lung was measured at 24 h after the initiation of treatment. Relationships between antibacterial effect and measures of exposure to unbound (               f               ) colistin (area under the concentration-time curve [               f               AUC/MIC], maximum concentration of drug in plasma [               fC               max               ]/MIC, and the time that the concentration in plasma is greater than the MIC [               fT               {$>$} MIC]) were examined by using an inhibitory sigmoid maximum-effect model. Nonlinearity in the PKs of colistin, including its plasma protein binding, was observed. The PK/PD index that correlated best with its efficacy was               f               AUC/MIC in both the thigh infection model (               R               2               = 87\%) and the lung infection model (               R               2               = 89\%). The               f               AUC/MIC targets required to achieve 1-log and 2-log kill against the three strains were 15.6 to 22.8 and 27.6 to 36.1, respectively, in the thigh infection model, while the corresponding values were 12.2 to 16.7 and 36.9 to 45.9 in the lung infection model. The findings of this               in vivo               study indicate the importance of achieving adequate time-averaged exposure to colistin. The results will facilitate efforts to define the more rational design of dosage regimens for humans.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Nephrotoxicity is a known adverse effect of polymyxin antibiotics, including colistin. Although previous meta-analyses have aimed to characterize colistin-associated nephrotoxicity risk relative to other antibiotics, included studies were observational in nature with high risk of confounding and heterogeneity. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis of exclusively randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the incidence of nephrotoxicity associated with colistin versus minimally nephrotoxic antibiotics.                                         Methods               We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and 3 trial registries for RCTs comparing the nephrotoxicity of colistin to nonpolymyxin antibiotics. Randomized controlled trials that used aminoglycosides were excluded. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. The study outcome was the rate of nephrotoxicity.                                         Results               Five RCTs with a total of 377 patients were included. Most patients received colistin for pneumonia in the intensive care unit, and the comparators were {$\beta$}-lactam-based regimens. Colistimethate sodium was dosed at 9 million units/day (300 mg/day of colistin base activity), with administration of a loading dose in 4 studies. The nephrotoxicity incidence in patients who received colistin was 36.2\% (95\% CI, 23.3\% to 51.3\%). The nephrotoxicity rate was significantly higher in the colistin arm than comparators (RR, 2.40; 95\% CI, 1.47 to 3.91; P {$\leq$} .001; I2 = 0\%), and the number needed to harm was 5. Findings persisted upon one-study-removed-analysis.                                         Conclusions               This meta-analysis of RCTs found a colistin-associated nephrotoxicity rate of 36.2\% and an increase in this risk compared with {$\beta$}-lactam-based regimens by 140\%. Colistin should be regarded as a last-line agent and safer alternatives should be considered when possible.},

In this review the factors that have been linked to this phenomenon are addressed. Profiles of bacterial species that are deemed to be particularly concerning at the present time are illustrated. Factors including economic impact, intrinsic and acquired drug resistance, morbidity and mortality rates, and means of infection are taken into account. Synchronously with the waxing of bacterial resistance there has been waning antibiotic development. The approaches that scientists are employing in the pursuit of new antibacterial agents are briefly described. The standings of established antibiotic classes as well as potentially emerging classes are assessed with an emphasis on molecules that have been clinically approved or are in advanced stages of development. Historical perspectives, mechanisms of action and resistance, spectrum of activity, and preeminent members of each class are discussed.},

The covariates may change their values over time. This article discusses the use of such time-dependent covariates, which offer additional opportunities but must be used with caution. The interrelationships between the outcome and variable over time can lead to bias unless the relationships are well understood. The form of a time-dependent covariate is much more complex than in Cox models with fixed (non--time-dependent) covariates. It involves constructing a function of time. Further, the model does not have some of the properties of the fixed-covariate model; it cannot usually be used to predict the survival (time-to-event) curve over time. The estimated probability of an event over time is not related to the hazard function in the usual fashion. An appendix summarizes the mathematics of time-dependent covariates.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a semimechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model describing chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression through drug-specific parameters and system-related parameters, which are common to all drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient leukocyte and neutrophil data after administration of docetaxel, paclitaxel, and etoposide were used to develop the model, which was also applied to myelosuppression data from 2'-deoxy-2'-methylidenecytidine (DMDC), irinotecan (CPT-11), and vinflunine administrations. The model consisted of a proliferating compartment that was sensitive to drugs, three transit compartments that represented maturation, and a compartment of circulating blood cells. Three system-related parameters were estimated: baseline, mean transit time, and a feedback parameter. Drug concentration-time profiles affected the proliferation of sensitive cells by either an inhibitory linear model or an inhibitory E(max) model. To evaluate the model, system-related parameters were fixed to the same values for all drugs, which were based on the results from the estimations, and only drug-specific parameters were estimated. All modeling was performed using NONMEM software. RESULTS: For all investigated drugs, the model successfully described myelosuppression. Consecutive courses and different schedules of administration were also well characterized. Similar system-related parameter estimates were obtained for the different drugs and also for leukocytes compared with neutrophils. In addition, when system-related parameters were fixed, the model well characterized chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression for the different drugs. CONCLUSION: This model predicted myelosuppression after administration of one of several different chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, with fixed system-related parameters to proposed values, and only drug-related parameters estimated, myelosuppression can be predicted. We propose that this model can be a useful tool in the development of anticancer drugs and therapies.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            With increasing clinical emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens and the paucity of new agents to combat these infections, colistin (administered as its inactive prodrug colistin methanesulfonate [CMS]) has reemerged as a treatment option, especially for critically ill patients. There has been a dearth of pharmacokinetic (PK) data available to guide dosing in critically ill patients, including those on renal replacement therapy. In an ongoing study to develop a population PK model for CMS and colistin, 105 patients have been studied to date; these included 12 patients on hemodialysis and 4 on continuous renal replacement therapy. For patients not on renal replacement, there was a wide variance in creatinine clearance, ranging from 3 to 169 ml/min/1.73 m               2               . Each patient was treated with a physician-selected CMS dosage regimen, and 8 blood samples for PK analysis were collected across a dosage interval on day 3 or 4 of therapy. A linear PK model with two compartments for CMS and one compartment for formed colistin best described the data. Covariates included creatinine clearance on the total clearance of CMS and colistin, as well as body weight on the central volume of CMS. Model-fitted parameter estimates were used to derive suggested loading and maintenance dosing regimens for various categories of patients, including those on hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement. Based on our current understanding of colistin PK and pharmacodynamic relationships, colistin may best be used as part of a highly active combination, especially for patients with moderate to good renal function and/or for organisms with MICs of {$\geq$}1.0 mg/liter.},

The study consisted of two parts: (1) a multicentre retrospective clinical study to assess the predictors of AKI during colistin therapy, defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria; and (2) bioinformatic and biochemical characterization of the possible interaction between human serum albumin and colistin. Among the 170 patients included in the study, 71 (42\%), 35 (21\%), and 11 (6\%) developed KDIGO stage 1 (K1-AKI), KDIGO stage 2 (K2-AKI), and KDIGO stage 3 (K3-AKI), respectively. In multivariable analyses, serum albumin {$<$}2.5\,g/dL was independently associated with K1-AKI (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 1.85, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.17--2.93, p\,=\,0.009) and K2-AKI (sHR 2.37, 95\% CI 1.15--4.87, p\,=\,0.019). Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses provided additional information nurturing the discussion on how hypoalbuminemia favors development of AKI during colistin therapy. In conclusion, severe hypoalbuminemia independently predicted AKI during colistin therapy in a large cohort of patients with BSI due to colistin-susceptible Gram-negative bacteria. Further study is needed to clarify the underlying causal pathways.},

This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.},

  abstract = {Colistin remains one of the few available options for the treatment of infections caused by resistant bacteria. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have been successful in estimating the appropriate colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) dose to achieve a target colistin concentration. Currently, there is a consensus that the dose of CMS should vary according to the patient renal function since CMS is mainly eliminated by renal route. For this same reason, the loading dose should vary according to the patient's renal capacity; however, this is not the current clinical practice. In this study we develop a framework to determine two key parameters for the loading dose regimen: (1) the optimal dose according to the characteristics (renal function and weight) of the patient; (2) the waiting time before the maintenance dose. Based on a previous PK model, our framework allows a fast parameter sweep so as to select optimal loading dose and waiting time minimizing the deviation between the plasma concentration and a target value. The results showed that patients presenting low creatinine clearance (CrCL) should receive a lower CMS loading dose with longer interval to start maintenance treatment to avoid nephrotoxic colistin concentrations. In cases of high CrCL, the dose should be higher and the interval to the next dose shorter to avoid subtherapeutic concentrations. Optimization of the loading dose should considerably improve colistin therapy, as the target concentration is reached more quickly, without reaching toxic values.},

There is however a lack of knowledge on best practices for covariate (pre)selection in pharmacometric repeated time-to-event (RTTE) models. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate the performance of three covariate (pre)selection tools for RTTE models: the likelihood ratio test (LRT), the empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) test, and a novel Schoenfeld-like residual test. This was done in simulated datasets with and without a Btrue{\textasciicircum} time-constant covariate, and both in the presence and absence of high EBE shrinkage. In scenarios with a Btrue{\textasciicircum} covariate effect, all tools had comparable power to detect this effect. In scenarios without a Btrue{\textasciicircum} covariate effect, the false positive rates of the LRT and the Schoenfeld-like residual test were slightly inflated to 5.7\% and 7.2\% respectively, while the EBE test had no inflated false positive rate. The presence of high EBE shrinkage ({$>$} 40\%) did not affect the performance of any of the covariate (pre)selection tools. We found the EBE test to be a fast and accurate tool for covariate preselection in RTTE models. The novel Schoenfeld-like residual test proposed here had a similar performance in the tested scenarios and might be applied more readily to time-varying covariates, such as drug concentration and dynamic biomarkers.},

For example, in the context of clinical trials of antibiotics for drug resistant infections, where patients with specific infections can be difficult to recruit, there is often only limited and heterogeneous information available from the historical trials. To make the best use of the combined information at hand, we consider an approach based on the multiple power prior that allows the prior weight of each historical study to be chosen adaptively by empirical Bayes. This choice of weight has advantages in that it varies commensurably with differences in the historical and current data and can choose weights near 1 if the data from the corresponding historical study are similar enough to the data from the current study. Fully Bayesian approaches are also considered. The methods are applied to data from antibiotics trials. An analysis of the operating characteristics in a binomial setting shows that the proposed empirical Bayes adaptive method works well, compared to several alternative approaches, including the meta-analytic prior.},

One potential solution to this problem is a statistical concept called intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. ITT analysis includes every subject who is randomized according to randomized treatment assignment. It ignores noncompliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and anything that happens after randomization. ITT analysis maintains prognostic balance generated from the original random treatment allocation. In ITT analysis, estimate of treatment effect is generally conservative. A better application of the ITT approach is possible if complete outcome data are available for all randomized subjects. Per-protocol population is defined as a subset of the ITT population who completed the study without any major protocol violations.},

  abstract = {The global burden of antibiotic resistance is tremendous and, without new anti-infective strategies, will continue to increase in the coming decades. Despite the growing need for new antibiotics, few pharmaceutical companies today retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. One reason is that it is scientifically challenging to discover new antibiotics that are active against the antibiotic-resistant bacteria of current clinical concern. However, the main hurdle is diminishing economic incentives. Increased global calls to minimize the overuse of antibiotics, the cost of meeting regulatory requirements and the low prices of currently marketed antibiotics are strong deterrents to antibacterial drug development programmes. New economic models that create incentives for the discovery of new antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue. DRIVE-AB is a E9.4 million public --private consortium, funded by the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative, that aims to define a standard for the responsible use of antibiotics and to develop, test and recommend new economic models to incentivize investment in producing new anti-infective agents.},

We aimed to assess the available data on the dosing strategy of colistin. A systematic review was performed to identify all published studies on the dose optimization of colistin. Grey literature and electronic databases were searched. Data were collected in a specified form and the quality of the included articles was then assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies, the Cochrane bias tool for randomized clinical trials (RCT), and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical checklist for case reports. A total of 19 studies were included, of which 16 were cohort studies, one was a RCT, and two were case reports. A total of 18 studies proposed a dosing regimen for adults, while only one study proposed a dosing schedule for pediatric populations. As per the available evidence, a loading dose of 9 million international units (MIU) of colistin followed by a maintenance dose of 4.5 MIU every 12 h was considered the most appropriate dosing strategy to optimize the safety and efficacy of treatment and improve clinical outcomes. This review supports the administration of a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of colistin in severe and life-threatening multi-drug Gram-negative bacterial infections.},

Yet there is no model of distribution ready for a new antibiotic that balances access against excessive or inappropriate use in rural settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of communicable diseases is high and access to quality health care is low. Departing from a hypothetical scenario of rising antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, 11 stakeholders in the health systems of various LMICs were interviewed one-on-one to give their view on how a new effective antibiotic should be distributed to balance access against the risk of inappropriate use. Transcripts were subjected to qualitative `framework' analysis. The analysis resulted in four main themes: Barriers to rational access to antibiotics; balancing access and excess; learning from other communicable diseases; and a system-wide intervention. The tension between access to antibiotics and rational use stems from shortcomings found in the health systems of LMICs. Constructing a sustainable yet accessible model of antibiotic distribution for LMICs is a task of health system-wide proportions, which is why we strongly suggest using systems thinking in future research on this issue.},

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) remain the leading cause of disease and death in children under five in low-income countries. Objective: To evaluate a multi-faceted intervention targeting health-care-providers' (HCPs) knowledge, practical competences and practices regarding antibiotic use for ARIs. Methods: A multi-faceted educational intervention with a two-armed randomised controlled design targeting HCPs treating ARIs in children was conducted in Bavi district, a rural district in Northern Vietnam in 2010--2011. Thirty-two communes of the district were randomized into two arms, with 144 HCPs in the intervention arm and 160 in the control arm. The intervention, conducted over seven months, comprised: (i) education regarding appropriate-antibiotic use, (ii) case scenario discussion and (iii) poster distribution. Questionnaires to assess knowledge and dispensing/prescribing forms to assess practice were completed before-and after interventions. The main outcome measures were differences in improvement in knowledge and practice in the intervention and control group, respectively. Results: Knowledge improved in the intervention group for ARI aetiology by 28\% ({$\Delta$}Decrement control arm 10\%), antibiotic use for mild ARIs by 15\% ({$\Delta$}Decrement control arm 13\%) and for severe ARIs by 14\% ({$\Delta$}Improvement control arm 29\%). Practical competence for a mild ARI case scenario improved in the intervention and control groups by 20\% and 11\%, respectively. Total knowledge score increased statistically in the intervention group ({$\Delta$}mean improvement 1.17); less so in the control group ({$\Delta$}mean improvement 0.48). Practice regarding antibiotics for mild ARIs improved by 28\% in the intervention group ({$\Delta$}Decrement control arm 3\%). Conclusions: The intervention significantly improved HCPs' knowledge of ARIs and practice of antibiotic use in treatment of ARIs. We suggest mixed method assessment and long-term follow-up of these interventions to enable better appreciation of the effects and effect sizes of our interventions.},

For management of ARIs, only 13\% of caregivers demonstrated correct overall knowledge in accordance with standard guidelines. The symptoms of the most recent illness were consistent with mild ARI in 79\% of cases, and antibiotics were used in 71\% of these. During the 28-day period, 62\% of children had been given antibiotics and 63\% of antibiotic courses were used for mild ARIs. One-half of the mild ARI episodes and 63\% of the children with mild ARIs were treated with antibiotics. Most of the unnecessary antibiotic treatment was recommended by healthcare providers (82\%). Most of the children had been administered antibiotics for common colds, although most caregivers believed that antibiotics were not required. Antibiotics were unnecessarily recommended at health facilities in the area.},

  abstract = {Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-ofsample predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA software.},

Methods Women from 18 to 49 years of age with symptoms of cystitis provided specimens of midstream urine, after which we collected urine by means of a urethral catheter for culture (catheter urine). We compared microbial species and colony counts in the paired specimens. The primary outcome was a comparison of positive predictive values and negative predictive values of organisms grown in midstream urine, with the presence or absence of the organism in catheter urine used as the reference.

N Engl J Med 2013;369:1883-91. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1302186 Copyright {\copyright} 2013 Massachusetts Medical Society Results The analysis of 236 episodes of cystitis in 226 women yielded 202 paired specimens of midstream urine and catheter urine that could be evaluated. Cultures were positive for uropathogens in 142 catheter specimens (70\%), 4 of which had more than one uropathogen, and in 157 midstream specimens (78\%). The presence of Escherichia coli in midstream urine was highly predictive of bladder bacteriuria even at very low counts, with a positive predictive value of 102 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of 93\% (Spearman's r\,=\,0.944). In contrast, in midstream urine, enterococci (in 10\% of cultures) and group B streptococci (in 12\% of cultures) were not predictive of bladder bacteriuria at any colony count (Spearman's r\,=\,0.322 for enterococci and 0.272 for group B streptococci). Among 41 episodes in which enterococcus, group B streptococci, or both were found in midstream urine, E. coli grew from catheter urine cultures in 61\%. Conclusions Cultures of voided midstream urine in healthy premenopausal women with acute uncomplicated cystitis accurately showed evidence of bladder E. coli but not of enterococci or group B streptococci, which are often isolated with E. coli but appear to rarely cause cystitis by themselves.

The distribution of BOS data is often non-standard, e.g., J- or U-shaped, thus making standard analysis methods that assume normality inappropriate. Data transformations aiming to achieve normality with BOS can be much more difficult than with many other types of skewed distributions, and application of methodologies explicitly dealing with this problem has not been previously published in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling literature. In this analysis, a coarsened latent variable (CO) approach is augmented with flexible transformations and applied for the purpose of demonstrating ustekinumab effects on four clinical components (involved body surface area, induration, erythema, and scaling) in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis from two Phase 3 studies. Patients were randomized to receive placebo or ustekinumab 45 or 90 mg, followed by randomized withdrawal and long-term extension periods. The approach was used together with a previously established novel semi-mechanistic, mixed-effect exposure-response model integrated with placebo effect and disease progression, and with potential influence of dropout investigated. An additional transformation further modifying both tails of the standard logit transformation in the original CO approach was shown to be necessary in this application.},

Endpoints with C 10 ordered categories are typically analyzed as continuous. This manuscript aims to show circumstances where it is advantageous to analyze such data as ordered categorical. The results of continuous and categorical analyses are compared in a latent-variable based Indirect Response modeling framework for the longitudinal modeling of Mayo scores, ranging from 0 to 12, which is commonly used as a composite endpoint to measure the severity of ulcerative colitis (UC). Exposure response modeling of Mayo scores is complicated by the fact that studies typically include induction and maintenance phases with re-randomizations and other response-driven dose adjustments. The challenges are illustrated in this work by analyzing data collected from 3 phase II/III trials of golimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe UC. Visual predictive check was used for model evaluations. The ordered categorical approach is shown to be accurate and robust compared to the continuous approach. In addition, a disease progression model with an empirical bi-phasic rate of onset was found to be superior to the commonly used placebo model with one onset rate. An application of this modeling approach in guiding potential dose-adjustment was illustrated.},

  abstract = {The informed consent document is intended to provide basic rights to patients but often fails to do so. Patients' autonomy may be diminished by virtue of their illness; evidence shows that even patients who appear to be ideal candidates for understanding and granting informed consent rarely are, particularly those with acute infections. We argue that for low-risk trials whose purpose is to evaluate nonexperimental therapies or other measures towards which the medical community is in a state of equipoise, ethics committees should play a more active role in a more standardized fashion. Patients in the clinic are continually subject to spontaneous `pseudo-randomizations' based on local dogma and the anecdotal experience of their physicians. Stronger ethics oversight would allow point-of-care trials to structure these spontaneous randomizations, using widely available informatics tools, in combination with opt-out informed consent where deemed appropriate.

  abstract = {The power prior has been widely used in many applications covering a large number of disciplines. The power prior is intended to be an informative prior constructed from historical data. It has been used in clinical trials, genetics, health care, psychology, environmental health, engineering, economics, and business. It has also been applied for a wide variety of models and settings, both in the experimental design and analysis contexts. In this review article, we give an A to Z exposition of the power prior and its applications to date. We review its theoretical properties, variations in its formulation, statistical contexts for which it has been used, applications, and its advantages over other informative priors. We review models for which it has been used, including generalized linear models, survival models, and random effects models. Statistical areas where the power prior has been used include model selection, experimental design, hierarchical modeling, and conjugate priors. Prequentist properties of power priors in posterior inference are established and a simulation study is conducted to further examine the empirical performance of the posterior estimates with power priors. Real data analyses are given illustrating the power prior as well as the use of the power prior in the Bayesian design of clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Background: Infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria have caused a resurgence of interest in colistin. To date, information about pharmacokinetics of colistin is very limited in critically ill patients, and no attempts have been made to evaluate its concentration in BAL. Methods: In this prospective, open-label study, 13 adult patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria were treated with colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) IV, 2 million International Units (174 mg) q8h, a usually recommended dose, for at least 2 days. Blood samples were collected from each patient at time intervals after the end of infusion. BAL was performed at 2 h. Colistin was measured by a selective, sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-based method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Results: Patients received 2.19 6 0.38 mg/kg (range, 1.58-3.16) of CMS per dose. At steady state, mean 6 SD plasma colistin maximum (Cmax) and trough (Ctrough) concentrations were 2.21 6 1.08 and 1.03 6 0.69 mg/mL, respectively. Mean 6 SD area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h (AUC0-8), apparent elimination half-life, and apparent volume of distribution were 11.5 6 6.2 mg 3 h/mL, 5.9 6 2.6 h, and 1.5 6 1.1 L/kg, respectively. Cmax/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio and AUC0-24/MIC ratio (MIC 5 2 mg/mL) were 1.1 6 0.5 and 17.3 6 9.3, respectively. Colistin was undetectable in BAL. Nephrotoxicity was not observed. Conclusions: Although the pharmacodynamic parameters that better predict the efficacy of colistin are not known in humans, in critically ill adult patients the IV administration of CMS 2 million International Units (174 mg) q8h results in apparently suboptimal plasma concentrations of colistin, which is undetectable in BAL. A better understanding of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of colistin is urgently needed to determine the optimal dosing regimen.},

Many toxicologists believe in vitro testing methods are a useful, time and cost effective tool for drug discovery but it is generally accepted that many of the available tests are not effective for examining both time and concentration, and do not closely mimic human kinetics. This is because they do not properly take into account pharmacodynamic actions (what a drug does to the body) and pharmacokinetic actions (what a body does to the drug). Recently, with the use of hollow fiber bioreactor cartridges, this has changed. The hollow fiber infection model is a useful addition to standard in vitro toxicology methods as it mimics changes in drug concentration over time, as they would occur in humans. An overview of historic pk/pd models is presented and the utility of the hollow fiber infection model as it relates to antibiotics and other drugs are discussed.},

Transition intensities may vary between individuals, or with piecewise-constant time-dependent covariates, giving an inhomogeneous Markov model. Hidden Markov models can be used for multi-state processes which are misclassified or observed only through a noisy marker. The package is intended to be straightforward to use, flexible and comprehensively documented. Worked examples are given of the use of msm to model chronic disease progression and screening.

  abstract = {Initial dose selection of antimicrobials typically involves the clinical integration of covariates of drug disposition such as age, sex, weight, and kidney function. However, dynamic clinical states and unaccountable confounders necessitate our measurement of systemic concentrations in an individual patient to better inform dose modification. Over the past 50 years, several research groups have formulated weight- and kidney function--based dosing algorithms to measure, assess, and optimize the dosing of aminoglycosides. The lessons learned from older aminoglycosides may be useful and have applications to newer antimicrobials that are dosed on weight and kidney function. This is especially true among obese patients, for whom optimal dosing algorithms have not been well defined. The purpose of this review is to provide healthcare providers a historical perspective of aminoglycoside therapeutic drug monitoring followed by an updated approach to improve dosing of these agents in obese adult patients. The authors had for objective to evaluate the applicability of AFSSAPS guidelines for aminoglycoside use to geriatric patients. Theoretical doses and dosing regimens allowing reaching target concentrations in this population were calculated by applying a pharmacokinetic model to 30 geriatric patients treated by amikacin. The dose allowing reaching a maximum concentration of 60 mg/L was 1.217 mg on average. The time required to reach a blood concentration lower than or equal to 2.5 mg/L was 62.5 {\textpm} 70.4 hours. Forty-six percent of patients had a trough concentration greater than 2.5 mg/L, 48 hours after administration. For these patients, the time between critical minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and toxicity threshold concentration was 21.9 {\textpm} 14.9 hours. Reaching a target concentration can be problematic in geriatric patients. It is frequently necessary to use dosing intervals greater than 48 hours. The effectiveness and safety of these regimens remain uncertain. {\'E}valuer l'applicabilit{\'e} des cibles propos{\'e}es par les recommandations Afssaps de bon usage des aminosides {\`a} une population g{\'e}riatrique. En appliquant un mod{\`e}le pharmacocin{\'e}tique sur 30 patients g{\'e}riatriques trait{\'e}s par amikacine, les doses et intervalles posologiques th{\'e}oriques permettant de respecter les concentrations cibles dans cette population ont {\'e}t{\'e} calcul{\'e}s. La dose permettant d'atteindre une concentration maximale de 60 mg/L {\'e}tait de 1217 mg en moyenne. Le temps n{\'e}cessaire pour obtenir une concentration sanguine inf{\'e}rieure ou {\'e}gale {\`a} 2,5 mg/L {\'e}tait de 62,5 {\textpm} 70,4 heures. Une concentration r{\'e}siduelle sup{\'e}rieure {\`a} 2,5 mg/L 48 heures apr{\`e}s l'administration {\'e}tait retrouv{\'e}e chez 46 \% des patients. Chez ces patients, le temps pass{\'e} entre la CMI critique et la concentration seuil de toxicit{\'e} {\'e}tait de 21,9 {\textpm} 14,9 heures. L'atteinte des concentrations cibles en g{\'e}riatrie peut poser probl{\`e}me. Un espacement sup{\'e}rieur {\`a} 48 heures des administrations semble fr{\'e}quemment n{\'e}cessaire. L'efficacit{\'e} et l'innocuit{\'e} de ces sch{\'e}mas demeurent incertaines. Les aminosides, dont l'amikacine, sont des antibiotiques d'int{\'e}r{\^e}t majeur dans la prise en charge du sepsis, mais ayant une toxicit{\'e} {\'e}lev{\'e}e. Les recommandations fran{\c c}aises actuelles proposent une dose d'amikacine de 15 {\`a} 30 mg/kg. L'objectif {\'e}tait d'{\'e}valuer si ces propositions permettent d'atteindre les concentrations cibles efficaces de 64 mg/L sans d{\'e}passer le seuil de toxicit{\'e} de 2,5 mg/L. {\`A} partir d'une cohorte de 100 patients trait{\'e}s par amikacine, les param{\`e}tres pharmacocin{\'e}tiques individuels ont {\'e}t{\'e} estim{\'e}s par un logiciel pharmacocin{\'e}tique (MM-USCPACK). Les concentrations maximales et r{\'e}siduelles obtenues apr{\`e}s des doses simul{\'e}es de 15 {\`a} 30 mg/kg ont {\'e}t{\'e} estim{\'e}es et compar{\'e}es aux seuils efficaces et toxiques. La dose individuelle permettant d'atteindre pr{\'e}cis{\'e}ment la concentration efficace a {\'e}t{\'e} calcul{\'e}e. Les patients pr{\'e}sentaient en moyenne un {\^a}ge de 79 ans, un poids de 58 kg et une clairance de la cr{\'e}atinine de 45 mL/min. La dose de 30 mg/kg permet d'atteindre un pic efficace pour 98,7 \% des patients, mais conduit {\`a} un r{\'e}siduel toxique pour 72,4 \% d'entre eux. La dose de 15 mg/kg permet d'atteindre les concentrations efficaces pour 14,5 \% des patients. La dose optimale moyenne {\'e}tait de 1264 mg, diff{\'e}rente des doses calcul{\'e}es avec le poids (p {$<$} 0,0001). Une faible corr{\'e}lation a {\'e}t{\'e} trouv{\'e}e entre le poids et la dose optimale. Si une dose de 30 mg/kg semble efficace pour la plupart des patients, la dose de 15 mg/kg peut s'av{\'e}rer insuffisante. La faible corr{\'e}lation entre dose optimale et le poids du patient illustre que le poids n'explique pas int{\'e}gralement la variabilit{\'e} interindividuelle. Aminoglycosides, including amikacin, are antibiotics with major interest in the management of sepsis, but with a high potential toxicity. The French national recommendations revised in 2011 recommend a dose of amikacin ranging from 15 to 30 mg/kg. The objective was to assess if such a dose interval allows reaching the efficiency target concentrations of 64 mg/L without exceeding the toxic threshold of 2.5 mg/L. From a cohort of 100 patients treated with amikacin, the individual pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using pharmacokinetic software (MM-USCPACK). Peak and residual concentrations obtained after simulated doses ranging from 15 to 30 mg/kg were estimated and compared with the effective and toxic thresholds. The optimum dose to achieve precisely the efficiency target was calculated for each patient. Patients studied had a mean age of 79 years, mean weight of 58 kg, and mean creatinine clearance of 45 mL/min. The dose of 30 mg/kg allows the achievement of an effective peak in 98.7\% of patients, but led to a potentially toxic through for 72.4\% of them. The optimal dose was at mean of 1264 mg, significantly different than doses calculated with weight (P {$<$} 0.0001). A weak correlation was found between weight and the optimal dose. A fixed dose of 30 mg/kg seems to be effective for most patients, but often excessive and leads to a toxic residual to 72\% of patients, whereas 15 mg/kg was insufficient for most patients. The low correlation between optimal dose and patient weight shows that weight does not explain fully the interindividual variability. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of aminoglycosides has been a topic during the last thirty years. There is a tendency that -- because of the once-daily regimen -- TDM is considered not necessary anymore. Although once daily dosing has the potential for decreased toxicity, long-term usage can cause severe nephro- and ototoxicity. Furthermore, inadequate plasma concentrations can lead to treatment failure. This work is devoted to the development and application of the first mathematical model of aminoglycosides, which simulates in relation to the pharmacokinetics both their effects on bacteria as well as their nephrotoxicity and cochleotoxicity. Our software system is suitable for TDM. Based on theoretical considerations, a multi-compartment mathematical model in a numerical program in Matlab is derived that incorporates the antimicrobial effects of aminoglycosides, the saturable and active uptake into kidney cells, the reversible nephrotoxicity and the irreversible cochleotoxicity. Using fictitious person data, and an assumed pharmacokinetic and dynamic parameter set obtained from the literature, we simulated the drug concentrations, antibacterial effects, and toxicity over time in virtual patients to illustrate the benefits of optimized, efficacious dosage regimens that minimize (acceptable) nephro- and auditory ototoxicity. Our model confirms that extended-interval dosing seems the most appropriate to achieve this goal. By this manner, the present mathematical model contributes to an increase in our knowledge of how to obtain an optimized dosing strategy for individual patients. With the developed program, we are able to demonstrate that optimal aminoglycoside dosing still needs a sophisticated system of TDM. L'utilisation de l'amikacine est d{\'e}licate en raison de sa toxicit{\'e} et de sa variabilit{\'e} pharmacocin{\'e}tique. Cette variabilit{\'e} est pratiquement ignor{\'e}e chez l'adulte puisque seul le poids est utilis{\'e} dans le calcul de la dose {\`a} administrer. Notre objectif est de tester si la pharmacocin{\'e}tique de l'amikacine peut {\^e}tre consid{\'e}r{\'e}e comme homog{\`e}ne, et si le mode de calcul de la dose en fonction du poids est adapt{\'e}. {\`A} partir d'une cohorte de 580 patients, cinq groupes homog{\`e}nes de patients ont {\'e}t{\'e} cr{\'e}{\'e}s par partitionnement de donn{\'e}es. Une analyse de pharmacocin{\'e}tique de population a {\'e}t{\'e} effectu{\'e}e dans chaque groupe. La population adulte n'est pas homog{\`e}ne au niveau pharmacocin{\'e}tique. Les doses n{\'e}cessaires pour atteindre une concentration maximale de 60 mg/L sont fortement diff{\'e}rentes (585 {\`a} 1507 mg). L'utilisation exclusive du poids pour calculer la dose {\`a} administrer est inappropri{\'e}e dans 80 \% des cas, montrant les limites des formules de calcul des doses d'aminosides. The use of amikacin is difficult because of its toxicity and its pharmacokinetic variability. This variability is almost ignored in adult standard dosage regimens since only the weight is used in the dose calculation. Our objective is to test if the pharmacokinetic of amikacin can be regarded as homogenous, and if the method for calculating the dose according to patients' weight is appropriate. From a cohort of 580 patients, five groups of patients were created by statistical data partitioning. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in each group. The adult population is not homogeneous in term of pharmacokinetics. The doses required to achieve a maximum concentration of 60 mg/L are strongly different (585 to 1507 mg) between groups. The exclusive use of the weight to calculate the dose of amikacine appears inappropriate for 80\% of the patients, showing the limits of the formulae for calculating doses of aminoglycosides.},

In such a case, it may happen that a subject becomes diseased between two visits and dies without being observed. Consequently, there is an uncertainty about the precise number of transitions. Estimating the intensity of transition from health to illness by survival analysis (treating death as censoring) is biased downwards. Furthermore, the dates of transitions between states are not known exactly. We propose to estimate the intensity functions by maximizing a penalized likelihood. The method yields smooth estimates without parametric assumptions. This is illustrated using data from a large cohort study on cerebral ageing. The age-specific incidence of dementia is estimated using an illness--death approach and a survival approach.},

Respiratory gases, collected in acid and base, were assayed for radioactivity. Blood specimens were obtained at intervals to furnish data on decay of labeled creatinine in the body pool. The data show that there is a true creatinine deficit (15.9 to 65.7\% of the creatinine formed is metabolized or excreted via extrarenal routes) in patients with decreased renal function. In these patients, creatinine is metabolized to CO2 and methylamine, presumably by the microflora of the gut.

In pharmacometrics, this is often done based on the standard errors from the variance--covariance matrix of the estimates. Confidence intervals derived in this way are by definition symmetrical, which may lead to implausible outcomes, and will require translation to generate uncertainties in derived variables. An often-used alternative is numerical percentile estimation by, for example, nonparametric bootstraps to circumvent these issues. Visual predictive checks (VPCs), which is a commonly used model diagnostic tool in pharmacometric analyses, also rely on the estimation of percentiles through numerical approaches. Given the cost in terms of run times and processing times for these methods, it is important to consider the trade-off between the number of bootstrap samples or simulated data sets in the VPCs, to the increase in precision related to a large number of bootstrap samples or simulated data sets. The objective with this tutorial is to provide a quantitative framework for assessing the precision in estimated percentile limits in bootstrap and visual predictive checks analyses to facilitate an informed choice of confidence interval width, number of bootstrap samples/simulated data sets, and required level of precision.},

However, effectively conveying these effects to key stakeholders and decision makers can be challenging. Forest plots have been proposed to meet these communication needs. However, forest plots for the illustration of covariate effects in pharmacometrics are complex combinations of model predictions, uncertainty estimates, tabulated results, and reference lines and intervals. The purpose of this tutorial is to outline the aspects that influence the interpretation of forest plots, recommend best practices, and offer specific guidance for a clear and transparent communication of covariate effects.},

A review of the available literature regarding intraventricular (IVT) or intrathecal (ITH) administration of colistin in MDR and XDR A. baumannii ventriculitis/meningitis was conducted and a total of 83 episodes in 81 patients were identified (71 cases in adults and 10 in children and neonates). Colistin was administered via the IVT and ITH route in 52 and 22 cases, respectively, whilst in 7 cases the exact route was not identified. The median dose of local colistin was 125000 IU (10mg) with a range of 20000 IU (1.6 mg) to 500000 IU (40 mg) in adults, whilst a dose of 2000 IU/kg (0.16 mg/kg) up to 125000 IU (10mg) was used in the paediatric population. The median duration of treatment of IVT/ITH polymyxin E was 18.5 days, whilst the median time to achieve sterilisation of cerebrospinal fluid was 4 days. The rate of successful outcome was 89\%, and toxicity related to treatment mainly manifested as reversible chemical ventriculitis/meningitis was reported in nine cases (11\%). Nowadays, IVT and ITH colistin represents the last resort treatment of MDR and XDR A. baumannii ventriculitis/meningitis, offering a unique, rather safe and successful mode of therapy.},

A LD of 9 million IU (MU) [ca. 270 mg of colistin base activity (CBA)] was administrated with a maintenance dose of 4.5 MU (ca. 140 mg CBA) every 12 h (q12h) to eight critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy. Blood samples were collected immediately before and at different time intervals after the LD and the fourth dose, whilst pre-filter and post-filter blood samples were also collected. CMS and colistin concentrations were determined using an LC-MS/MS assay. Median maximum observed concentrations after the LD were 22.1 mg/L for CMS and 1.55 mg/L for colistin, whereas during maintenance dosing the corresponding values were 12.6 mg/L and 1.72 mg/L, respectively. CVVHDF clearance was determined as 2.98 L/h for colistin, equivalent to 62\% of total apparent colistin clearance in CVVHDF patients. Both CMS and colistin were cleared by CVVHDF. Application of a LD of 9 MU CMS resulted in more rapid achievement of the target colistin concentration. Following implementation of a predicted pharmacokinetic model on plasma CMS/colistin concentrations, a LD of 12 MU CMS appears more appropriate, whilst a CMS maintenance dosage of at least 6.5--7.5 MU q12h is suggested in patients undergoing CVVHDF. However, further clinical studies are warranted to assess the safety of a LD of 12 MU CMS in patients receiving CVVHDF. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Colistin adheres to a range of materials, including plastics in labware. The loss caused by adhesion influences an array of methods detrimentally, including MIC assays and               in vitro               time-kill experiments. The aim of this study was to characterize the extent and time course of colistin loss in different types of laboratory materials during a simulated time-kill experiment without bacteria or plasma proteins present. Three types of commonly used large test tubes, i.e., soda-lime glass, polypropylene, and polystyrene, were studied, as well as two different polystyrene microplates and low-protein-binding microtubes. The tested concentration range was 0.125 to 8 mg/liter colistin base. Exponential one-phase and two-phase functions were fitted to the data, and the adsorption of colistin to the materials was modeled with the Langmuir adsorption model. In the large test tubes, the measured start concentrations ranged between 44 and 102\% of the expected values, and after 24 h, the concentrations ranged between 8 and 90\%. The half-lives of colistin loss were 0.9 to 12 h. The maximum binding capacities of the three materials ranged between 0.4 and 1.1 {$\mu$}g/cm               2               , and the equilibrium constants ranged between 0.10 and 0.54 ml/{$\mu$}g. The low-protein-binding microtubes showed start concentrations between 63 and 99\% and concentrations at 24 h of between 59 and 90\%. In one of the microplates, the start concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification at worst. In conclusion, to minimize the effect of colistin loss due to adsorption, our study indicates that low-protein-binding polypropylene should be used when possible for measuring colistin concentrations in experimental settings, and the results discourage the use of polystyrene. Furthermore, when diluting colistin in protein-free media, the number of dilution steps should be minimized.},

The former assumption leads to parametric models, whereas the latter leads to the semi-parametric Cox model which is by far the most popular in survival analysis. However, a parametric model may lead to more efficient estimates than the Cox model under certain conditions. Only a few parametric models are closed under the PH assumption, the most common of which is the Weibull that accommodates only monotone hazard functions. We propose a generalization of the log-logistic distribution that belongs to the PH family. It has properties similar to those of log-logistic, and approaches the Weibull in the limit. These features enable it to handle both monotone and nonmonotone hazard functions. Application to four data sets and a simulation study revealed that the model could potentially be very useful in adequately describing different types of time-to-event data.},

  abstract = {A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis is important in antibiotic chemotherapy. Basically, the in vivo efficacy of antibiotics that exert concentration-dependent effects can be predicted using conventional PK/PD indices such as the ratio of the area under the curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) and/or the ratio of the maximum plasma concentration to MIC (Cmax/ MIC), whereas that of antibiotics with time-dependent effects can be determined using the period of time for which the drug concentration exceeds the MIC (time above MIC [TAM]). However, an optimal PK/PD index remains to be established for some antibiotics. Thus, a PK/PD model which describes the PK profile and effect of an antibiotic was developed, and the results obtained from this model were interpreted to form a PK/ PD index map to assess the optimal PK/PD index for the antibiotic. The findings from the map were generally consistent with clinical outcomes even for the antibiotics which proved to be exceptions to the conventional classification. For example, AUC/MIC was an optimal index for azithromycin despite its time-dependent bactericidal activity, and Cmax/MIC was a poor index for arbekacin despite its concentration-dependent profile. Thus, the map would be useful for selecting the appropriate PK/PD index for an antibiotic.},

An increasing score (range 0 to 71) was closely correlated with the subsequent risk of hospital death for 5815 intensive care admissions from 13 hospitals. This relationship was also found for many common diseases.When APACHE II scores are combined with an accurate description of disease, they can prognostically stratify acutely ill patients and assist investigators comparing the success of new or differing forms of therapy. This scoring index can be used to evaluate the use of hospital resources and compare the efficacy of intensive care in different hospitals or over time.},

Treating infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria is a challenge for medical practitioners and increases patient mortality and cost of care globally. This vulnerability, along with strategies to tackle antimicrobial resistance development, prompts the development of new antibiotic agents and exploration of alternative treatment options. This article summarises the new antibiotics that have recently been approved for Gram-negative bacterial infections, looks down the pipeline at promising agents currently in phase I, II, or III clinical trials, and introduces new alternative avenues that show potential in combating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.},

Nascent murine reticulocytes formed in vitro by enucleation of Friend virus--infected erythroblasts were purified and recultured for 110 hours. At 0 hours, all recultured cells were lobulated and contained dense, centralized reticulin. By 110 hours, about 20\% to 25\% of the cells became biconcave erythrocytes. Most ribosomes and cellular RNAs were degraded within 20 hours, and during that period, heme synthesis declined from a rate equal to that of late erythroblasts to less than 10\% of that rate. Many mitochondria appeared normal until they showed outer membrane swelling, degradation, and apparent fusion with intracellular vacuoles at 40 hours of culture. During the period of mitochondrial loss, Bcl-XL, an antiapoptotic protein that accumulates during erythroblast differentiation and maintains mitochondrial membrane integrity, demonstrated progressive decreases and changes consistent with deamidation. Nevertheless, the reticulocytes did not undergo apoptosis, because their apoptotic machinery was degraded. This experimental system that provides a developmentally synchronized population of nascent murine reticulocytes that mature into biconcave erythrocytes in vitro should be useful in further investigations of the cellular events involved in reticulocyte maturation.},

  abstract = {Purpose Antibiotic dose predictions based on PK/PD indices rely on that the index type and magnitude is insensitive to the pharmacokinetics (PK), the dosing regimen, and bacterial susceptibility. In this work we perform simulations to challenge these assumptions for meropenem and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods A published murine dose fractionation study was replicated in silico. The sensitivity of the PK/PD index towards experimental design, drug susceptibility, uncertainty in MIC and different PK profiles was evaluated. Results The previous murine study data were well replicated with fT {$>$} MIC selected as the best predictor. However, for increased dosing frequencies fAUC/MIC was found to be more predictive and the magnitude of the index was sensitive to drug susceptibility. With human PK fT {$>$} MIC and fAUC/ MIC had similar predictive capacities with preference for fT {$>$} MIC when short t1/2 and fAUC/MIC when long t1/2. Conclusions A longitudinal PKPD model based on in vitro data successfully predicted a previous in vivo study of meropenem. The type and magnitude of the PK/PD index were sensitive to the experimental design, the MIC and the PK. Therefore, it may be preferable to perform simulations for dose selection based on an integrated PK-PKPD model rather than using a fixed PK/PD index target.},

  abstract = {Beginning in the 1940s, mass production of antibiotics involved the industrialscale growth of microorganisms to harvest their metabolic products. Unfortunately, the use of antibiotics selects for resistance at answering scale. The turn to the study of antibiotic resistance in microbiology and medicine is examined, focusing on the realization that individual therapies targeted at single pathogens in individual bodies are environmental events affecting bacterial evolution far beyond bodies. In turning to biological manifestations of antibiotic use, sciences fathom material outcomes of their own previous concepts. Archival work with stored soil and clinical samples produces a record described here as `the biology of history': the physical registration of human history in bacterial life. This account thus foregrounds the importance of understanding both the materiality of history and the historicity of matter in theories and concepts of life today.},

We developed and evaluated novel equations to estimate baseline creatinine in patients with AKI on CKD.                                         Methods               We retrospectively analysed 5649 adults with AKI out of 11\,254 CKD patients, dividing them evenly into derivation and validation groups. Using quantiles regression, we created equations to estimate baseline creatinine, considering historical creatinine values, months since measurement, age, and sex from the derivation dataset. We assessed performance against back-estimation equations and unadjusted historical creatinine values using the validation dataset.                                         Results               The optimal equation adjusted the most recent creatinine value for time since measurement and sex. Estimates closely matched the actual baseline at AKI onset, with median (95\% confidence interval) differences of just 0.9\% (-0.8\% to 2.1\%) and 0.6\% (-1.6\% to 3.9\%) when the most recent value was within 6\,months to 30\,days and 2\,years to 6\,months before AKI onset, respectively. The equation improved AKI event reclassification by an additional 2.5\% (2.0\% to 3.0\%) compared to the unadjusted most recent creatinine value and 7.3\% (6.2\% to 8.4\%) compared to the CKD-EPI 2021 back-estimation equation.                                         Conclusion               Creatinine levels drift in patients with CKD, causing false positives in AKI detection without adjustment. Our novel equation adjusts the most recent creatinine value for drift over time. It provides more accurate baseline creatinine estimation in patients with suspected AKI on CKD, which reduces false-positive AKI detection, improving patient care and management.                        ,              Summary at a Glance             Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases patients' risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Estimated baseline creatinine is required to diagnose AKI. However, CKD complicates estimation of baseline creatinine levels. Kidney function declines in CKD, leading to a rise in creatinine levels, which means patients without recent creatinine values may be wrongly diagnosed with AKI. In this study of 5649 adults with AKI on CKD, using conventional approaches for comparison, we developed and validated new equations with better accuracy and reclassification performance to estimate baseline creatinine in patients with AKI on CKD.},

We evaluated four conventional equations to estimate creatinine. We then developed and validated a new equation corrected by age and gender.                                         Methods               We retrospectively examined adults who, at first hospital admission, had available baseline creatinine data and developed acute kidney injury {$\geq$}24\,h after admission. We split the study population: 50\% (derivation) to develop a new linear equation and 50\% (validation) to compare against conventional equations for bias, precision, and accuracy. We stratified analyses by age and gender.                                         Results               We studied 3139 hospitalized adults (58\% male, median age 71). Conventional equations performed poorly in bias and accuracy in patients aged {$<$}60 or {$\geq$}75 (68\% of the study population). The new linear equation had less bias and more accuracy. There were no clinically significant differences in precision. The median (95\% confidence interval) difference in creatinine values estimated via the new equation minus measured baselines was 0.9 (-3.0, 5.9) and -0.5 (-7.0, 3.7) {$\mu$}mol/L in female patients 18--60 and 75--100, and -1.5 (-4.2, 2.2) and -7.8 (-12.7, -3.6) {$\mu$}mol/L in male patients 18--60 and 75--100, respectively. The new equation improved reclassification of KDIGO AKI stages compared to the MDRD II equation by 5.0\%.                                         Conclusion               Equations adjusted for age and gender are less biased and more accurate than unadjusted equations. Our new equation performed well in terms of bias, precision, accuracy, and reclassification.                        ,              SUMMARY AT A GLANCE                            There are several ways to estimate baseline creatinine values for hospitalized patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Conventional approaches use rearranged versions of the MDRD II or CKD-EPI equations, substituting a fixed glomerular filtration rate of 75\,ml/min/1.73\,m               2               to back-estimate creatinine. We found these approaches produced biased estimates in patients {$<$}60 or {$\geq$}75\,years old. Because of this, we developed and validated new age- and gender-adjusted equations to estimate creatinine baseline values. These new equations performed better in bias, precision, and accuracy and improved reclassification of KDIGO AKI stages.},

Although there has been extensive research in the area of fixed effects models, much less attention has been paid to random effects models. In this context we distinguish between theoretical identifiability, in which different parameter values lead to non-identical probability distributions, structural identifiability which concerns the algebraic properties of the structural model, and practical identifiability, whereby the model may be theoretically identifiable but the design of the experiment may make parameter estimation difficult and imprecise. We explore a number of pharmacokinetic models which are known to be non-identifiable at an individual level but can become identifiable at the population level if a number of specific assumptions on the probabilistic model hold. Essentially if the probabilistic models are different, even though the structural models are non-identifiable, then they will lead to different likelihoods. The findings are supported through simulations.},

  abstract = {Background: Serum creatinine concentration is widely used as an index of renal function, but this concentration is affected by factors other than glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Objective: To develop an equation to predict GFR from serum creatinine concentration and other factors. Design: Cross-sectional study of GFR, creatinine clearance, serum creatinine concentration, and demographic and clinical characteristics in patients with chronic renal disease. Patients: 1628 patients enrolled in the baseline period of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study, of whom 1070 were randomly selected as the training sample; the remaining 558 patients constituted the validation sample. Methods: The prediction equation was developed by stepwise regression applied to the training sample. The equation was then tested and compared with other prediction equations in the validation sample. Results: To simplify prediction of GFR, the equation included only demographic and serum variables. Independent factors associated with a lower GFR included a higher serum creatinine concentration, older age, female sex, nonblack ethnicity, higher serum urea nitrogen levels, and lower serum albumin levels (P Ͻ 0.001 for all factors). The multiple regression model explained 90.3\% of the variance in the logarithm of GFR in the validation sample. Measured creatinine clearance overestimated GFR by 19\%, and creatinine clearance predicted by the Cockcroft--Gault formula overestimated GFR by 16\%. After adjustment for this overestimation, the percentage of variance of the logarithm of GFR predicted by measured creatinine clearance or the Cockcroft--Gault formula was 86.6\% and 84.2\%, respectively. Conclusion: The equation developed from the MDRD Study provided a more accurate estimate of GFR in our study group than measured creatinine clearance or other commonly used equations.},

Setting---Research studies and clinical populations (``studies'') with measured GFR. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006. Patients---Equation development in 10 studies (8254 people) and validation in 16 studies (3896 people). Prevalence estimates based on 16,032 people. Measurements---GFR measured as the clearance of exogenous filtration markers (iothalamate in the development dataset; iothalamate and other markers in the validation dataset). Linear regression to estimate the logarithm of measured GFR from standardized creatinine, sex, race and age. Results---In the validation dataset, the CKD-EPI performed better than the MDRD Study equation (p{$<$}0.001 for all subsequent comparisons), especially at higher GFR: lesser bias (median difference between measured and estimated GFR of 2.5 vs. 5.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively); improved precision (interquartile range of the differences of 16.6 vs. 18.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively); and greater accuracy (percent of estimated GFR within 30\% of measured GFR of 84.1 vs. 80.6\%, respectively. In NHANES, median (interquartile range) estimated GFR was 94.5 (79.7 -- 108.1) vs. 85.0 (72.9 -- 98.5) mL/min/1.73 m2, and the prevalence (95\% confidence interval) of CKD was 11.5 (10.6, 12.4) \% vs. 13.1 (12.1, 14.0) \%, respectively. Limitations---Limited number of elderly people and racial and ethnic minorities with measured GFR. Conclusions---The CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate than the MDRD Study equation and could replace it for routine clinical use.},

  abstract = {We recently developed and validated an equation 10 predicl GFR from serum creatinine (Pcr), which is more accurate than creatinine clearance measured from 24-hour urine samples or predicted from the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equalion (Levey AS. Ann Intern Med 1999; 130:877-884). GFR is expressed as mI/min/1.73 m2. Required variables include Per (mg/dl), age (y), race (black vs. non-black), gender, serum urea nitrogen (SUN, mg/dl) and albumin (alb, g/dI). In clinical practice and in retrospective studies, measurements of SUN and alb may not be available. Below we list the full MDRD Study prediction equation (6 variables), as well as alternative prediction equations including fewer variables derived from measurements in the same 1628 patients. GFR = 170 x Pcr-0.999 x age-0.176 x 1.180 (if black) x 0.762 (if female) x SUN-0.170 x alb+0.318 GFR = 270 x Pcr-1.007 x age-0.180 x 1.178 (if black) x 0.755 (if female) x SUN-0.169 GFR = 186 x Pcr-1.154 x age-0.203 x 1.212 (if black) x 0.742 (if female) The table below compares the performance of these equations and the CG equation. ------------------ R ---- median delta -- 75th\% delta -- 90th\% delta 6 variables -- .903 -- 11.3\% ---------- 19.8\% --------- 28.4\% 5 variables -- .899 -- 11.6\% ---------- 19.9\% --------- 29.4\% 4 variables -- .892 -- 12.1\% ---------- 20.5\% --------- 29.7\% CG ------------ .842 -- 13.8\% ---------- 26.4\% --------- 40.5\% Delta = absolute value of the median (50th), 75th and 90th percentiles of the distribution of the differences between measured GFR and predicted GFR or Ccr for each equation (includes bias correction for CG equation). We conclude that simplified versions of the MDRD Study prediction equation provide more accurate estimates of GFR than measured or estimated creatinine clearance.},

  abstract = {Here we describe the effect of colistin on the barrier function of the mammalian urinary bladder epithelium. Addition of colistin to the mucosal solution of the rabbit urinary bladder epithelium (urothelium) resulted in an increase in the transepithelial conductance. The magnitude of the increase in transepithelial conductance was dependent on the membrane voltage, concentration of colistin, and presence of divalent cations in the bath solution. The initial site of action of colistin was at the apical membrane. Colistin increased the membrane conductance only when the apical membrane potential was cell interior negative. The more negative the membrane potential, the larger the conductance increase. The concentration dependence of the conductance increase saturated, suggesting a membrane binding site. Divalent cations decreased the magnitude of the conductance increase. This divalent cation action occurred at two sites: one in competition with colistin for a membrane binding site, and the other by rapidly blocking the induced conductance. At short exposure times, the increase in conductance was reversed by either removing colistin from the bath or changing the voltage so that the apical membrane was cell interior positive. At long exposure times, the increase was only partially reversible by voltage or removal from the bath. This finding suggests that at long exposure times, there is a toxic effect of colistin on the urothelium.},

In this article we describe a programming library, Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN), intended for programmers that aim at using the computational capability of NONMEM in external applications. The library is object oriented and written in the programming language Perl. The classes of the library are built around NONMEM's data, model and output files. The specification of the NONMEM model is easily set or changed through the model and data file classes while the output from a model fit is accessed through the output file class. The classes have methods that help the programmer perform common repetitive tasks, e.g. summarising the output from a NONMEM run, setting the initial estimates of a model based on a previous run or truncating values over a certain threshold in the data file. PsN creates a basis for the development of high-level software using NONMEM as the regression tool.},

  abstract = {Augmented renal clearance (ARC) is a manifestation of enhanced renal function seen in critically ill patients. The use of regular unadjusted doses of renally eliminated drugs in patients with ARC might lead to therapy failure. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide and up-to-date summary of the available evidence pertaining to the phenomenon of ARC. A literature search of databases of available evidence in humans, with no language restriction, was conducted. Databases searched were MEDLINE (1946 to April 2017), EMBASE (1974 to April 2017) and the Cochrane Library (1999 to April 2017). A total of 57 records were included in the present review: 39 observational studies (25 prospective, 14 retrospective), 6 case reports/series and 12 conference abstracts. ARC has been reported to range from 14 to 80\%. ARC is currently defined as an increased creatinine clearance of greater than 130 mL/min/1.73 m2 best measured by 8--24 h urine collection. Patients exhibiting ARC tend to be younger ({$<$}50 years old), of male gender, had a recent history of trauma, and had lower critical illness severity scores. Numerous studies have reported antimicrobials treatment failures when using standard dosing regimens in patients with ARC. In conclusion, ARC is an important phenomenon that might have significant impact on outcome in critically ill patients. Identifying patients at risk, using higher doses of renally eliminated drugs or use of non-renally eliminated alternatives might need to be considered in ICU patients with ARC. More research is needed to solidify dosing recommendations of various drugs in patients with ARC.},

In the 2011 EMA -- European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) Workshop on Modelling and Simulation, European regulators agreed to the necessity to build expertise to be able to review M\&S data provided by companies in their dossier. This led to the establishment of the EMA Modelling and Simulation Working Group (MSWG). Also, there was agreement reached on the need for harmonization on good M\&S practices and for continuing dialog across all parties. The MSWG acknowledges the initiative of the EFPIA Model-Informed Drug Discovery and Development (MID3) group in promoting greater consistency in practice, application, and documentation of M\&S and considers the paper is an important contribution towards achieving this objective.},

  abstract = {Background.{$\quad$} CRE BSIs have high mortality and limited treatment options. PLZ is a next-generation aminoglycoside with activity against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. CARE was a phase 3, open-label study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of PLZ in patients with infections due to CRE. The aim of this exploratory analysis was to evaluate outcomes in the subgroup with CRE BSI. Methods.{$\quad$} CARE enrolled 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 (C1), a randomized comparison of PLZ vs. CST and Cohort 2 (C2), a single-arm study of PLZ in patients ineligible for C1. Patients in C1 received PLZ (15 mg/kg q24h) or CST (300-mg load [colistin base activity] then 5 mg/kg/d) plus tigecycline or meropenem. Patients in C2 received PLZ plus investigator's choice of adjunctive agent. Treatment was 7--14 days. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality (ACM) at Day 28 or significant disease-related complications (SDRCs) in patients with confirmed CRE who received {$\geq$}1 dose of study drug (mMITT population). Clearance of bacteremia by Day 5 required 2 negative cultures {$\geq$}24 hours apart with sustained clearance through the study period. Serum creatinine levels were assessed by a central lab. Results.{$\quad$} Of 39 patients enrolled in C1, 30 had BSI (29 mMITT). PLZ patients had lower ACM at Day 28 or SDRCs and ACM at Day 28 compared with CST patients and higher rates of bacteremia clearance by Day 5 (Table). Lack of clearance in PLZ patients was due to recurrence beyond Day 5 (1 pt) and insufficient follow-up to demonstrate clearance (1 pt); 6 CST patients failed to clear by Day 5 and 2 had recurrence beyond Day 5. 10\%(1/10) of PLZ and 25\% (3/12) of CST patients experienced a {$\geq$}0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine from baseline through the end of therapy. Of 30 patients enrolled in C2, 15 had BSI (14 mMITT). ACM at Day 28 or SDRCs and ACM at Day 28 were 35.7\% (5/14) and 14.3\% (2/14), respectively. Clearance of bacteremia at Day 5 was observed in 64.3\% (9/14); of the 5 whose bacteremia did not clear, 1 failed to clear by Day 5 and 4 had recurrence beyond Day 5. A {$\geq$}0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine through the end of therapy was reported in 33.3\% (4/12). Conclusion.{$\quad$} PLZ was associated with improved survival and microbiological clearance compared with CST in C1 patients with BSI; outcomes in C2 were supportive of these findings. PLZ may be an important potential new treatment option for patients with CRE BSI.},

This is a particular challenge for low and middle-income countries with pluralistic health systems where antibiotics are available in a number of different markets. This review paper considers access and use of antibiotics in these countries from a complex adaptive system perspective. It highlights the main areas of intervention that could provide the key to addressing the sustainable long term use and availability of antibiotics. A focus on the synergies between interventions addressing access strategies, antibiotic quality, diagnostics for lowresource settings, measures to encourage just and sustainable decision making and help seeking optimal therapeutic and dosing strategies are key levers for the sustainable future of antibiotic use. Successful integration of such strategies will be dependent on effective governance mechanisms, effective partnerships and coalition building and accurate evaluation systems at national, regional and global levels.},

  abstract = {Recent clinical studies performed in a large number of patients showed that colistin ``forgotten'' for several decades revived for the management of infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) and had acceptable effectiveness and considerably less toxicity than that reported in older publications. Colistin is a rapidly bactericidal antimicrobial agent that possesses a significant postantibiotic effect against MDR Gram-negative pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The optimal colistin dosing regimen against MDR GNB is still unknown in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. A better understanding of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of colistin is urgently needed to determine the optimal dosing regimen. Although pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in ICU patients are scarce, recent evidence shows that the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of colistimethate sodium and colistin in critically ill patients differ from those previously found in other groups, such as cystic fibrosis patients. The AUC:MIC ratio has been found to be the parameter best associated with colistin efficacy. To maximize the AUC:MIC ratio, higher doses of colistimethate sodium and alterations in the dosing intervals may be warranted in the ICU setting. In addition, the development of colistin resistance has been linked to inadequate colistin dosing. This enforces the importance of colistin dose optimization in critically ill patients. Although higher colistin doses seem to be beneficial, the lack of colistin pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data results in difficulty for the optimization of daily colistin dose. In conclusion, although colistin seems to be a very reliable alternative for the management of life-threatening nosocomial infections due to MDR GNB, it should be emphasized that there is a lack of guidelines regarding the ideal management of these infections and the appropriate colistin doses in critically ill patients with and without multiple organ failure.},

  abstract = {1. Creatinine metabolism was studied in nine patients with severe chronic renal failure who were nevertheless in a nearly steady state with respect to their creatinine pool. Labelled creatinine was injected intravenously and the specific radioactivity of creatinine in urine was measured during the ensuing 5--7 days.             2. In each patient, the decline in specific radioactivity with time was a single exponential function after 12 h. The volume of distribution of creatinine averaged 49.1 {\textpm} 2.8\% body weight. The average rate of creatinine production was 148 {$\mu$}mol day-1 kg-1, which is similar to predicted values for normal subjects of the same age, weight and sex. Creatinine metabolism rate/kg body weight, estimated as the difference between production rate/kg body weight, determined radioisotopically, and creatinine appearance rate (excretion plus accumulation), averaged 42 {$\mu$}mol day-1 kg-1.             3. Total creatinine metabolism rate/kg body weight was correlated with serum creatinine. Thus, as serum creatinine rises, an increasing fraction of the produced creatinine was metabolized rather than excreted. This relationship could account for the diminished creatinine excretion commonly seen in patients with chronic renal failure.             4. Extrarenal clearance (metabolism/serum creatinine) of this magnitude (approximately 31\% of renal clearance in these patients) would be an undetectably small fraction of normal renal clearance. This could explain the absence of demonstrable creatinine metabolism in normal subjects.             5. Two pathways of metabolism were identified: a recycling of creatinine to creatine and an irreversible degradation of creatinine to products other than creatine.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Combination therapy can be a strategy to ensure effective bacterial killing when treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium with high potential for developing resistance. The aim of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that describes the in vitro bacterial time -- kill curves of colistin and meropenem alone and in combination for one WT and one meropenemresistant strain of P. aeruginosa. Methods: In vitro time -- kill curve experiments were conducted with a P. aeruginosa WT (ATCC 27853) (MICs: meropenem 1 mg/L; colistin 1 mg/L) and a meropenem-resistant type (ARU552) (MICs: meropenem 16 mg/L; colistin 1.5 mg/L). PK/PD models characterizing resistance were fitted to the observed bacterial counts in NONMEM. The final model was applied to predict the bacterial killing of ARU552 for different combination dosages of colistin and meropenem. Results: A model with compartments for growing and resting bacteria, where the bacterial killing by colistin reduced with continued exposure and a small fraction (0.15\%) of the start inoculum was resistant to meropenem, characterized the bactericidal effect and resistance development of the two antibiotics. For a typical patient, a loading dose of colistin combined with a high dose of meropenem (2000 mg q8h) was predicted to result in a pronounced kill of the meropenem-resistant strain over 24 h. Conclusions: The developed PK/PD model successfully described the time course of bacterial counts following exposures to colistin and meropenem, alone and in combination, for both strains, and identified a dynamic drug interaction. The study illustrates the application of a PK/PD model and supports high-dose combination therapy of colistin and meropenem to overcome meropenem resistance.},

The objectives of this study were to develop a pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) model that characterizes the time course of the antibacterial activity of colistin against P. aeruginosa in a static in vitro system and to perform simulations of different dosing regimens and dosing algorithms to evaluate the effect of interindividual variability and interoccasion variability in PK on bacterial killing. Methods: Static in vitro time --kill curve experiments were conducted on two different strains of P. aeruginosa (MIC 1 and 1.5 mg/L). Mechanism-based PK/PD models were fitted in NONMEM7 and the final model was combined with a previously developed population PK model of CMS and colistin to perform simulations of variability based on different dosing algorithms. Results: A model with compartments for growing and resting bacteria, with a function allowing the maximal bacterial killing of colistin to reduce upon increasing colistin exposure, characterized both the fast bactericidal effect and the adaptive resistance. The variability in PK was shown to translate into pronounced interoccasion variability in bacterial killing. A flat fixed loading dose was demonstrated to result in less variability than an algorithm based on weight. Conclusions: The developed PK/PD model described the growth, death and resistance development of P. aeruginosa in response to colistin for two different strains. Based on simulations, a flat fixed loading dose followed by an 8 or 12 hourly maintenance dose with an infusion duration of up to 2 h appeared adequate.},

The development of biomarkers to diagnose AKI, quantify risk and predict prognosis is receiving considerable attention. Yet techniques to accurately assess functional changes within patients still rely on the use of an insensitive marker (creatinine), creatinine-based estimating equations and unreliable urinary tests. Therefore, it is critical that functional tests be developed and used in combination with biomarkers, thus allowing improved care in AKI and chronic kidney disease patient populations.},

  abstract = {Course of acute renal failure studied by a model of creatinine kinetics. A computerized model of creatinine kinetics was developed to predict the relationship between creatinine clearance [G(t)] and plasma creatinine concentration [C(t)] in patients with postischemic acute renal failure (ARF). A comparison of predicted to measured values in 35 episodes of ARF in 27 patients revealed three patterns of declining G(t) following an ischemic insult. Pattern A, characterized by an abrupt step decrement in G(t) following an isolated renal ischemic episode lasting minutes or hours, was observed in nine patients. It was followed invariably by an immediate ramp increment in G(t), despite which C(t) continued to increase for several days. Urinary indices during the period of increasing azotemia were consistent with the resolving stage of ARF. Patterns B (N = 15) and C (N = 11) were associated with persistent renal ischemia of long (days to weeks) duration and were respectively characterized by prolonged ramp or exponential decrements in G(t). A concurrent increase in C(t) was associated with urinary indices typical of the maintenance or sustained stage of ARF. Recovery of G(t) was observed in only two-thirds of patterns B and C cases and took the form of a ramp or exponential increment. Because G(t) and total body water were changing rapidly in ARF, changes in measured plasma creatinine levels alone failed to identify these patterns of deteriorating or improving renal function. However, when the computerized model was used in conjunction with daily measured values of C(t) and body weight and occasional estimates of G(t), the course and prognosis of ARF in individual patients were illuminated.

  abstract = {Objectives: Although testing of antimicrobial agents for susceptibility has inherent variability like any assay, it is generally held that there are also real differences in susceptibility between strains. In the routine laboratory, variability of the MIC measurement may be sufficient to mask real strain differences. We determined which factors contributed to the variability, using linezolid against Staphylococcus aureus as one example. Methods: Twenty-five S. aureus strains were sent to five different laboratories in quadruplicate in a blinded fashion. Laboratories determined MICs of linezolid using Etest. Results of 22 strains corresponding to 440 observations were available for analysis. Sources of variability were explored and quantified using an ANOVA approach. Results: The overall geometric mean MIC was 1.8 mg/L, comparable to that of the published WT distribution of 1.7 mg/L (www.eucast.org). The total variation amounted to  1.3 2-fold dilutions for a one-sided CI of 95\% and two 2-fold dilutions for a CI of 99\%. Variation between laboratories and variation between strains contributed 10\% and 48\%, and in a subset analysis averaging 17\% and 26\%, respectively. Strain-to-strain variation (biological variation) could not be reliably determined, even with four replicates. Conclusions: This analysis serves as an example of an approach to discerning various sources of MIC variation. Here, at best, a single measurement of an MIC may provide an indication of whether it likely belongs to the WT distribution. Only repeated measurements of MICs for individual strains within one laboratory may provide an indication of differences in susceptibility between strains.},

Many of these old antibiotics were approved long ago, in an era when there was no clear process for development, and requirements for efficacy to be demonstrated in rigorous clinical trials did not exist. At the time of these approvals, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles were largely unknown, and did not inform the dose-finding process or recommendations for optimal usage. Indeed, the task of generating basic vital information for these old antibiotics remains to be performed. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the most essential data needed for dose justification and optimization. An overview of the shortage of data for selected old antibiotics illustrates the scope of the problem. In order to prevent harming patients with clinical decisions based on inadequate evidence, a redevelopment procedure for old antibiotics is urgently needed, including a regulatory framework.},

While their benefits are now unanimously recognized, international standards for their evaluation, accepted by all stakeholders involved, are still to be established. In this white paper, we propose a risk-informed evaluation framework for mechanistic model credibility evaluation. To properly frame the proposed verification and validation activities, concepts such as context of use, regulatory impact and risk-based analysis are discussed. To ensure common understanding between all stakeholders, an overview is provided of relevant                in silico                terminology used throughout this paper. To illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have applied it to three real case examples in the context of drug development, using a credibility matrix currently being tested as a quick-start tool by regulators. Altogether, this white paper provides a practical approach to model evaluation, applicable in both scientific and regulatory evaluation contexts.},

  abstract = {Cetrorelix (CET) is a potent luteinizing hormone---releasing hormone (LH-RH) antagonist and is used to prevent premature ovulation in IVF (in vitro fertilization) procedures. The objective of the present study was to develop a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for the LH suppression and LH surge delay after single doses (SD) and multiple doses (MD) of CET in healthy premenopausal women without ovarian stimulation. CET was given by subcutaneous route (SD, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg) on cycle day 3 and as similar multiple once-a-day doses from cycle day 3 to day 16 in two consecutive menstrual cycles. The concentration-time data of CET and LH were used for PK/PD modeling. A two-compartment model described the PK of CET with median terminal half-life estimates of 9.2 and 54.5 hours after SD and MD, respectively. An indirect-response E                                max                              model was used to describe the LH suppression and the LH surge delay. LH suppression was linked to plasma concentrations of CET, while the delay in the LH surge was linked to the PK of CET through a hypothetical effect compartment. Since the SD regimen on day 3 did not cause significant delay, these values were used as controls in the analysis of surge delay in MD data. The IC                                50                              (for suppression) estimate was 0.73 ng/ml for SD, and EC                                50                              (surge delay) was 1.42 ng/ml for MD. The PK/PD model adequately described the LH suppression and the surge delay.},

  abstract = {Background.{$\quad$} Intravenous colistin is difficult to use because plasma concentrations for antibacterial effect overlap those causing nephrotoxicity, and there is large interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics. The aim was to develop dosing algorithms for achievement of a clinically desirable average steady-state plasma colistin concentration (Css,avg) of 2 mg/L. Methods.{$\quad$} Plasma concentration-time data from 214 adult critically ill patients (creatinine clearance, 0--236 mL/min; 29 receiving renal replacement therapy [RRT]) were subjected to population pharmacokinetic analysis. Development of an algorithm for patients not receiving RRT was based on the relationship between the dose of colistimethate that would be needed to achieve a desired Css,avg and creatinine clearance. The increase in colistin clearance when patients were receiving RRT was determined from the population analysis and guided the supplemental dosing needed. To balance potential antibacterial benefit against risk of nephrotoxicity the algorithms were designed to achieve target attainment rates of {$>$}80\% for Css,avg {$\geq$}2 and {$<$}30\% for Css,avg {$\geq$}4 mg/L. Results.{$\quad$} When algorithm doses were applied back to individual patients not receiving RRT (including those prescribed intermittent dialysis on a nondialysis day), {$>$}80\% of patients with creatinine clearance {$<$}80 mL/min achieved Css,avg {$\geq$}2 mg/L, but for patients with creatinine clearance {$\geq$}80 mL/min, the target attainment was {$<$}40\%, even with the maximum allowed daily dose of 360 mg colistin base activity. For patients receiving RRT, target attainment rates were {$>$}80\% with the proposed supplemental dosing. In all categories of patients, {$<$}30\% of patients attained Css,avg {$\geq$}4 mg/L. Conclusions.{$\quad$} The project has generated clinician-friendly dosing algorithms and pointed to circumstances in which intravenous monotherapy may be inadequate.},

  abstract = {Adaptive designs can make clinical trials more flexible by utilising results accumulating in the trial to modify the trial's course in accordance with pre-specified rules. Trials with an adaptive design are often more efficient, informative and ethical than trials with a traditional fixed design since they often make better use of resources such as time and money, and might require fewer participants. Adaptive designs can be applied across all phases of clinical research, from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory trials. The pace of the uptake of adaptive designs in clinical research, however, has remained well behind that of the statistical literature introducing new methods and highlighting their potential advantages. We speculate that one factor contributing to this is that the full range of adaptations available to trial designs, as well as their goals, advantages and limitations, remains unfamiliar to many parts of the clinical community. Additionally, the term adaptive design has been misleadingly used as an all-encompassing label to refer to certain methods that could be deemed controversial or that have been inadequately implemented. We believe that even if the planning and analysis of a trial is undertaken by an expert statistician, it is essential that the investigators understand the implications of using an adaptive design, for example, what the practical challenges are, what can (and cannot) be inferred from the results of such a trial, and how to report and communicate the results. This tutorial paper provides guidance on key aspects of adaptive designs that are relevant to clinical triallists. We explain the basic rationale behind adaptive designs, clarify ambiguous terminology and summarise the utility and pitfalls of adaptive designs. We discuss practical aspects around funding, ethical approval, treatment supply and communication with stakeholders and trial participants. Our focus, however, is on the interpretation and reporting of results from adaptive design trials, which we consider vital for anyone involved in medical research. We emphasise the general principles of transparency and reproducibility and suggest how best to put them into practice.},

  abstract = {Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) represent an increasing hazard in healthcare settings. A central question concerning the treatment of invasive infections caused by CR-GNB involves the use of combination therapy. Potential advantages of combination therapy include improved efficacy due to synergy, while the disadvantages include adverse events and increased antibiotic use with a potential drive towards resistance. Several observational studies have examined whether combination therapy offers an advantage over colistin/ polymyxin monotherapy. We highlight the inherent limitations of these studies related to their observational design and sample size to show why they do not at present provide an answer to the question of combination versus monotherapy. This distinction is important to guide clinical practice until solid evidence has been obtained and to enable the recruitment of patients into randomized controlled trials. A few randomized controlled trials examining specific combinations have recently been completed or are ongoing. Currently, however, there is no evidence-based support for most combination therapies against CR-GNB, including colistin/carbapenem combination therapy.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To assess the external validity of a pragmatic, investigator-initiated RCT on treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we compared patient characteristics and treatment effect estimates for patients included in the RCT versus those excluded. Participants and outcomes: The RCT included hospitalised patients with documented or highlyprobable invasive MRSA infections who were randomised to vancomycin versus trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) treatment, between 2007 and 2014. A concomitant observational study prospectively included all consecutive patients, between 2008 and 2011, who were excluded from the RCT due to no consent, meningitis, left-sided endocarditis, severe neutropaenia, chronic renal dialysis or treatment with study medications for longer than 48 h. The primary outcomes were clinical failure at day 7 and 30-day mortality for both studies. We compared baseline and infection characteristics, outcome rates and treatment effect estimates for included versus excluded patients. Results: The RCT included 252 patients who were compared with 220 excluded patients who were observed. Inability to provide informed consent was the main reason for patient exclusion. Excluded patients' functional and cognitive performance was significantly poorer than that of included patients. Sepsis was more severe among excluded patients (higher rates of mechanical ventilation, indwelling catheters, septic shock and organ failure). Clinical failure occurred in 83/252 (32.9\%) versus 175/220 (79.5\%) and deaths in 32 (12.7\%) versus 64 (29.1\%) for included versus excluded patients, p{$<$}0.001 for both comparisons. Comparing vancomycin to TMPSMX, in the RCT mortality, was non-significantly lower with vancomycin (OR 0.76, 95\% CIs 0.36 to 1.62), while in the observational analysis of excluded patients, mortality was significantly higher with vancomycin (OR 2.63, 1.04 to 6.65), p=0.04 for the difference. Conclusions: Patient characteristics, outcome event rates and treatment effects differed significantly in the setting of a RCT, despite its pragmatic design, compared to patients treated outside the trial settings.},

The objective of our study was to assess the performance of the kinetic estimated GFR (KeGFR) and Jelliffe equations to estimate GFR in AKI, using a radioisotopic method (technetium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) as a reference measure.                                         Methods               We conducted a prospective multicenter observational study in hospitalized patients with AKI. We computed the Jelliffe and KeGFR equations to estimate GFR and compared these estimations to measured GFR (mGFR) by a radioisotopic method. The performances were assessed by correlation, Bland--Altman plots and smoothed and linear regressions. We conducted stratified analyses by age and chronic kidney disease (CKD).                                         Results               The study included 119 patients with AKI, mostly from the intensive care unit (63\%) and with Stage 1 AKI (71\%). The eGFR obtained from the Jelliffe and KeGFR equations showed a good correlation with mGFR (r\,=\,0.73 and 0.68, respectively). The median eGFR by the Jelliffe and KeGFR equations was less than the median mGFR, indicating that these equations underestimated the mGFR. On Bland--Altman plots, the Jelliffe and KeGFR equations displayed a considerable lack of agreement with mGFR, with limits of agreement \&gt;40\,mL/min/1.73\,m2. Both equations performed better in CKD and the KeGFR performed better in older patients. Results were similar across AKI stages.                                         Conclusions               In our study, the Jelliffe and KeGFR equations had good correlations with mGFR; however, they had wide limits of agreement. Further studies are needed to optimize the prediction of mGFR with estimatation equations.},

Many questions regarding the clinical use of polymyxins have been answered, but whether the administration of polymyxins in combination with other antibiotics leads to better outcomes remains unknown. This review discusses the limitations of observational studies that suggest a benefit of combinations of colistin and carbapenems to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), especially Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae, and summarizes the results of randomized controlled trials in which treatment with colistin in combination with meropenem or rifampin does not lead to better clinical outcomes than colisitn monotherapy in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). Although the introduction of new antibiotics makes it possible to treat certain strains of CRE and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) with polymyxin-sparing regimens, the use of polymyxins is, for now, still necessary in CRAB and in CRE and CRPA harboring metallo-beta-lactamases. Therefore, strategies must be developed to optimize polymyxin-based treatments, informed by in vitro hollow fiber models, careful clinical observations, and high-quality evidence from appropriately designed trials.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnosis is based on an increase in plasma creatinine, which is a slowly changing surrogate of decreased glomerular filtration rate. We investigated whether serial creatinine clearance, a direct measure of the glomerular filtration rate, provided more timely and accurate information on renal function than serial plasma creatinine in critically ill patients. Methods: Serial plasma creatinine and 4-hour creatinine clearance were measured 12-hourly for 24 hours and then daily in 484 patients. AKI was defined either as {$>$} 50\% increase in plasma creatinine from baseline, or {$>$} 33.3\% decrease in creatinine clearance. The diagnostic and predictive performance of the two AKI definitions were compared. Results: Creatinine clearance decrease diagnosed AKI in 24\% of those not diagnosed by plasma creatinine increase on entry. These patients entered the ICU sooner after insult than those diagnosed with AKI by plasma creatinine elevation (P = 0.0041). Mortality and dialysis requirement increased with the change in creatinine clearance-acute kidney injury severity class (P = 0.0021). Amongst patients with plasma creatinine {$<$} 1.24 mg/dl on entry, creatinine clearance improved the prediction of AKI considerably (Net Reclassification Improvement 83\%, Integrated Discrimination Improvement 0.29). On-entry, creatinine clearance associated with AKI severity and duration (P {$<$} 0.0001) predicted dialysis need (area under the curve: 0.75) and death (0.61). A {$>$} 33.3\% decrease in creatinine clearance over the first 12 hours was associated with a 2.0-fold increased relative risk of dialysis or death. Conclusions: Repeated 4-hour creatinine clearance measurements in critically ill patients allow earlier detection of AKI, as well as progression and recovery compared to plasma creatinine.

IRF has been proposed as an early marker of engraftment. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content is useful in assessing the functional iron available for erythropoiesis, and reticulocyte volume is a useful indicator when monitoring the therapeutic response of anemias.},

The utility of this class is limited by its dose-dependent nephrotoxicity, which can occur in more than one-half of patients receiving therapy with either agent. Strategies are urgently needed to optimise the use of this class of agents to ensure optimal activity while minimising the treatmentlimiting nephrotoxicity.

Although the current preclinical pipeline is well stocked with novel candidates, the last U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antibiotic with a novel mechanism of action against Gram-negative bacteria was discovered nearly 60\,years ago. Of all the antibiotic candidates that initiated investigational new drug (IND) applications in the 2000s, 17\% earned FDA approval within 12\,years, while an overwhelming 62\% were discontinued in that time frame. These ``leaks'' in the clinical pipeline, where compounds with clinical potential are abandoned during clinical development, indicate that scientific innovations are not reaching the clinic and providing benefits to patients. This is true for not only novel candidates but also candidates from existing antibiotic classes with clinically validated targets. By identifying the sources of the leaks in the clinical pipeline, future developmental efforts can be directed toward strategies that are more likely to flow into clinical use. In this review, we conduct a detailed failure analysis of clinical candidates with Gram-negative activity that have fallen out of the clinical pipeline over the past decade. Although limited by incomplete data disclosure from companies engaging in antibiotic development, we attempt to distill the developmental challenges faced by each discontinued candidate. It is our hope that this insight can help de-risk antibiotic development and bring new, effective antibiotics to the clinic.},

  abstract = {Standard survival data measure the time span from some time origin until the occurrence of one type of event. If several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. Multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. Methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. Examples of analysis with standard software are shown. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background. Morbidity and mortality for critically ill patients with infections remains a global healthcare problem. We aimed to determine whether {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients achieves concentrations associated with maximal activity and whether antibiotic concentrations affect patient outcome. Methods. This was a prospective, multinational pharmacokinetic point-prevalence study including 8 {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics. Two blood samples were taken from each patient during a single dosing interval. The primary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets were free antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen at both 50\% (50\% f T{$>$}MIC) and 100\% (100\% f T{$>$}MIC) of the dosing interval. We used skewed logistic regression to describe the effect of antibiotic exposure on patient outcome. Results. We included 384 patients (361 evaluable patients) across 68 hospitals. The median age was 61 (interquartile range [IQR], 48--73) years, the median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 18 (IQR, 14--24), and 65\% of patients were male. Of the 248 patients treated for infection, 16\% did not achieve 50\% f T{$>$}MIC and these patients were 32\% less likely to have a positive clinical outcome (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; P = .009). Positive clinical outcome was associated with increasing 50\% f T{$>$}MIC and 100\% f T{$>$}MIC ratios (OR, 1.02 and 1.56, respectively; P {$<$} .03), with significant interaction with sickness severity status. Conclusions. Infected critically ill patients may have adverse outcomes as a result of inadeqaute antibiotic exposure; a paradigm change to more personalized antibiotic dosing may be necessary to improve outcomes for these most seriously ill patients.},

Locally D-optimal designs are investigated for a quadratic dose--response model for log-transformed data subject to right censoring. Two-stage adaptive D-optimal designs using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model updating are explored through simulation for a range of different dose--response scenarios and different amounts of censoring in the model. The adaptive optimal designs are found to be nearly as efficient as the locally D-optimal designs. A popular equal allocation design can be highly inefficient when the amount of censored data is high and when the Weibull model hazard is increasing. The issues of sample size planning/early stopping for an adaptive trial are investigated as well. The adaptive D-optimal design with early stopping can potentially reduce study size while achieving similar estimation precision as the fixed allocation design.

  abstract = {In this Ph.D. thesis, we investigate how to optimize the design of clinical trials by constructing optimal adaptive designs, and how to implement the design by adaptive randomization. The results of the thesis are summarized by four research papers preceded by three chapters: an introduction, a short summary of the results obtained, and possible topics for future work. In Paper I, we investigate the structure of a D-optimal design for dose-finding studies with censored time-to-event outcomes. We show that the D-optimal design can be much more efficient than uniform allocation design for the parameter estimation. The D-optimal design obtained depends on true parameters of the dose-response model, so it is a locally D-optimal design. We construct two-stage and multi-stage adaptive designs as approximations of ~the D-optimal design when prior information about model parameters is not available. Adaptive designs provide very good approximations to the locally D-optimal design, and can potentially reduce total sample size in a study with a pre-specified stopping criterion. In Paper II, we investigate statistical properties of several restricted randomization procedures which target unequal allocation proportions in a multi-arm trial. We compare procedures in terms of their operational characteristics such as balance, randomness, type I error/power, and allocation ratio preserving (ARP) property. We conclude that there is no single ``best'' randomization procedure for all the target allocation proportions, but the choice of randomization can be done through computer-intensive simulations for a particular target allocation. In Paper III, we combine the results from the papers I and II to implement optimal designs in practice when the sample size is small. The simulation study done in the paper shows that the choice of randomization procedure has an impact on the quality of dose-response estimation. An adaptive design with a small cohort size should be implemented with a procedure that ensures a ``well-balanced'' allocation according to the D-optimal design at each stage. In Paper IV, we obtain an optimal design for a comparative study with unequal treatment costs and investigate its properties. We demonstrate that unequal allocation may decrease the total study cost while having the same power as traditional equal allocation. However, a larger sample size may be required. We suggest a strategy on how to choose a suitable randomization procedure which provides a good trade-off between balance and randomness to implement optimal allocation. If there is a strong linear trend in observations, then the ARP property is important to maintain the type I error and power at a certain level. Otherwise, a randomization-based inference can be a good alternative for non-ARP procedures.},

Several host response-based biomarkers due to infection have been suggested to allow discrimination of bacterial and non-bacterial microbial RTI etiology. This review provides an overview of clinical studies that investigated the diagnostic performance of host-response proteomic biomarkers to identify RTI microbial etiology. Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein have been studied most extensively; whereof procalcitonin has demonstrated the strongest diagnostic performance compared to other biomarkers. Proadrenomedullin, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1, neopterin and pentraxin-3 need more studies to confirm their diagnostic value. For syndecan-4 and lipocalin-2 currently insufficient evidence exists. Common limitations in several of the studies were the relatively small scale setting, heterogeneous patient population and the absence of statistical power calculation.},

We examined the effect of once- versus twice- or thrice-daily doses of colistin on renal function. (2) Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate {$\geq$} 50 mL/min who received intravenously the same colistin dose once (regimen A), twice (regimen B) or thrice daily (regimen C). The primary endpoint was acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as fulfilment of any of the RIFLE (Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End stage renal disease) criteria. (3) Results: We included 306 patients; 132 (43.1\%) received regimen A, 151 (49.3\%) regimen B, and 23 (7.5\%) regimen C. Ninety-nine (32.4\%) patients developed AKI; there was no difference between regimen A vs. B and C [45 (34.1\%) vs. 54 (31.0\%), p = 0.57]. In a propensity score--matched cohort, AKI was similar in patients receiving Regimen A, Regimen B, and Regimen C (31.6\% vs. 33.3\%, p = 0.78). On logistic regression analysis, diabetes was an independent predictor of AKI (OR = 4.59, 95\% CI 2.03--10.39, p = 0.001) while eGFR {$>$} 80 mL/min (OR = 0.50, 95\% CI 0.25--0.99, p = 0.048) was inversely associated with AKI. (4) Conclusions: Colistin once daily is not more nephrotoxic than the standard colistin regimens.

  abstract = {Empirical Bayes (``post hoc'') estimates (EBEs) of {$\eta$}s provide modelers with diagnostics: the EBEs themselves, individual prediction (IPRED), and residual errors (individual weighted residual (IWRES)). When data are uninformative at the individual level, the EBE distribution will shrink towards zero ({$\eta$}-shrinkage, quantified as 1-SD({$\eta$}EBE)/{$\omega$}), IPREDs towards the corresponding observations, and IWRES towards zero ({$\varepsilon$}-shrinkage, quantified as 1-SD(IWRES)). These diagnostics are widely used in pharmacokinetic (PK) pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling; we investigate here their usefulness in the presence of shrinkage. Datasets were simulated from a range of PK PD models, EBEs estimated in nonlinear mixed effects modeling based on the true or a misspecified model, and desired diagnostics evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Identified consequences of {$\eta$}-shrinkage on EBE-based model diagnostics include non-normal and/or asymmetric distribution of EBEs with their mean values (``ETABAR'') significantly different from zero, even for a correctly specified model; EBE--EBE correlations and covariate relationships may be masked, falsely induced, or the shape of the true relationship distorted. Consequences of {$\varepsilon$}-shrinkage included low power of IPRED and IWRES to diagnose structural and residual error model misspecification, respectively. EBE-based diagnostics should be interpreted with caution whenever substantial {$\eta$}- or {$\varepsilon$}-shrinkage exists (usually greater than 20\% to 30\%). Reporting the magnitude of {$\eta$}- and {$\varepsilon$}-shrinkage will facilitate the informed use and interpretation of EBE-based diagnostics.},

Materials and Methods Retrospective cohort study at a single-tertiary-care Midwestern university hospital of 4022 patients admitted to the intensive care unit between January 2006 and January 2012 immediately after cardiac surgery. Measurements and Main Results Of 4022 patients, 1031 (25.6\%) developed at least AKI stage 1 and 1106 (27.5\%) developed AKI-min. Patients who developed AKI stage 1 or AKI-min had a greater decrease in keGFR, both by absolute amounts and by percentage. After adjusting for other factors with logistic regression, keGFR had good discrimination (c statistic = 0.787 and 0.749, respectively) in predicting AKI and operative mortality. Conclusion Despite no change in immediate perioperative serum creatinine levels, keGFR fell and this predicted subsequent AKI. Using keGFR enables identification of patients who, despite unchanged postoperative creatinine, incur clinically significant kidney injury based on reduction in GFR and increased mortality.},

Common surrogate estimates can misclassify AKI and adversely affect the study of related outcomes. This study examined whether multiple imputation improved accuracy of estimating missing BCr beyond current recommendations to apply assumed estimated GFR (eGFR) of 75 ml/min per 1.73 m                 2                 (eGFR 75).                                                        Design, setting, participants, \& measurements                                From 41,114 unique adult admissions (13,003 with and 28,111 without BCr data) at Vanderbilt University Hospital between 2006 and 2008, a propensity score model was developed to predict likelihood of missing BCr. Propensity scoring identified 6502 patients with highest likelihood of missing BCr among 13,003 patients with known BCr to simulate a ``missing'' data scenario while preserving actual reference BCr. Within this cohort (                 n                 =6502), the ability of various multiple-imputation approaches to estimate BCr and classify AKI were compared with that of eGFR 75.                                                        Results                                All multiple-imputation methods except the basic one more closely approximated actual BCr than did eGFR 75. Total AKI misclassification was lower with multiple imputation (full multiple imputation + serum creatinine) (9.0\%) than with eGFR 75 (12.3\%;                 P                 {$<$}0.001). Improvements in misclassification were greater in patients with impaired kidney function (full multiple imputation + serum creatinine) (15.3\%) versus eGFR 75 (40.5\%;                 P                 {$<$}0.001). Multiple imputation improved specificity and positive predictive value for detecting AKI at the expense of modestly decreasing sensitivity relative to eGFR 75.                                                        Conclusions               Multiple imputation can improve accuracy in estimating missing BCr and reduce misclassification of AKI beyond currently proposed methods.},

The cells were incubated in vitro for 5 days with hemolysis less than 5\%. Maturation of reticulocytes was studied with 4 different systems: new methylene blue-stained smears and flow cytometry after auramine O, oxazine 750, or thiazole orange staining. The maturation process from reticulocytes to erythrocytes had a half-life of 30 hours estimated by visual counting. Reticulocytes analyzed with flow cytometers had half-lives of 20, 28, and 29 hours with Coulter Epics XL, Sysmex R-1000, and Bayer H*3 devices, respectively. Total maturation time was 4 to 5 days. During maturation, the reticulocyte MCV gradually decreased with a concomitant increase in reticulocyte MCHC. The reticulocytes synthesized hemoglobin, and the MCH of the cells increased approximately 7\% during the incubation period. Taking into account loss of hemoglobin-containing vesicles during reticulocyte maturation, we estimated that more than 20\% of hemoglobin in erythrocytes was synthesized in reticulocytes after release from bone marrow.},

The use of the models often exceeds descriptory roles and this change in their context of use increase the requirements on the evidence to support that they are credible. However, when it comes to assessing the trust in a model for a specific application, current tools are skewed to technical aspects and guidance documents often focused on model reporting or the iterative learning loops of model informed drug development (MIDD). There is an unmet need for a holistic tool that provide an end-to-end link from the initial question to the model-informed decision. We suggest the risk-informed credibility framework can be used for this purpose and offers strong support for the pharmacometrics models. We also introduce two tables for explicit description of key attributes of the model evaluation to facilitate and streamline the communication between stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Optimal dosage regimens of colistin for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) are unknown. Colistimethate sodium (CMS), the inactive prodrug of colistin, is mainly excreted in urine and converts to colistin after filtration by glomeruli, suggesting that concentrations of colistin in urine could be much higher than in plasma. Therefore, there is a need to optimize dosage regimens of intravenous CMS for UTI. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between AUC/MIC of formed colistin and clinical outcomes in patients with UTI caused by extremely drug resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Methods: This prospective, observational cohort study involved patients with UTI caused by XDR P. aeruginosa. Clinical cure, bacteriological clearance and acute kidney injury (AKI) were analyzed. Steady-state colistin plasma concentrations (Css) were measured using HPLC. Based on the PK/PD of colistin in neutropenic mouse thigh infection models with P. aeruginosa, the optimal AUC/MIC should be {$\geq$}60 mg{$\cdot$}h/L. According to the pharmacokinetics (PK) in critically-ill patients, the Css target of formed colistin in plasma was 2.5 mg/L. Results: Thirty-three patients were included (24 lower UTI and 9 pyelonephritis). The MIC50 and MIC90 values for colistin were 0.5 and 2 mg/L respectively. Nineteen patients (57.6\%) received colistin monotherapy (84.2\% lower UTI and 15.8\% pyelonephritis). Of these, clinical cure was achieved in 89.5\% of cases. Among patients with clinical cure and monotherapy, only 5 (29.4\%) attained an optimal plasma AUC/MIC and only 1 (5.9\%) the therapeutic level of formed colistin (2.5 mg/L). However, 10 (58.8\%) patients showed colistin plasma concentrations above the MIC of the isolated P. aeruginosa. Microbiological eradication was achieved in 76.9\% of patients. AKI at the end of treatment was present in 29.4\% of patients. Conclusions: The currently recommended dosage regimens of CMS showed high efficacy for the treatment of lower complicated UTI caused by XDR P. aeruginosa in non-critically ill patients and in the case of low MIC values, but also a considerable nephrotoxicity rate. Our data suggest that the use of lower CMS doses for lower UTI should be investigated in future studies to minimize the unnecessary nephrotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Colistin is administered as its inactive prodrug colistimethate (CMS). Selection of an individualized CMS dose for each patient is difficult due to its narrow therapeutic window, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our aim was to analyze CMS use in patients with CKD. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety and efficacy of CMS in this special population. In this prospective observational cohort study of CMS-treated CKD patients, CKD was defined as the presence of a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) {$<$} 60 mL/min/m2 for more than 3 months. The administered doses of CMS were compared with those recently published in the literature. Worsened CKD at the end of treatment (EOT) was evaluated with the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria. Colistin plasma concentrations (Css) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Fifty-nine patients were included. Thirty-six (61.2\%) were male. The median age was 76 (45--95) years and baseline GFR was 36.6 {\textpm} 13.6. The daily mean CMS dosage used was compared with recently recommended doses (3.36 vs. 6.07; p {$<$} 0.001). Mean Css was 0.9 (0.2--2.9) mg/L, and Css was {$<$}2 mg/L in 50 patients (83.3\%). Clinical cure was achieved in 43 (72.9\%) patients. Worsened renal function at EOT was present in 20 (33.9\%) patients and was reversible in 10 (52.6\%). The CMS dosages used in this cohort were almost half those currently recommended. The mean achieved Css were under the recommended target of 2 mg/dL. Despite this, clinical cure rate was high. In this patient cohort, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was similar to those found in other recent studies performed in the general population and was reversible in 52.6\%. These results suggest that CMS is safe and effective in patients with CKD and may encourage physicians to adjust dosage regimens to recent recommendations in order to optimize CMS treatments.},

  abstract = {Background: No comprehensive systematic review of the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement methods using renal inulin clearance as reference has been published. Study Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis of cross-sectional diagnostic studies. Setting \& Population: Published original studies and systematic reviews in any population. Selection Criteria for Studies: Index and reference measurements conducted within 48 hours; at least 15 participants studied; GFR markers measured in plasma or urine; plasma clearance calculation algorithm verified in another study; tubular secretion of creatinine had not been blocked by medicines. Index Tests: Endogenous creatinine clearance; renal or plasma clearance of chromium 512labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), iohexol, and iothalamate; and plasma clearance of inulin. Reference Test: Renal inulin clearance measured under continuous inulin infusion and urine collection. Results: Mean bias , 10\%, median bias , 5\%, the proportion of errors in the index measurements that did not exceed 30\% (P30) \$ 80\%, and P10 \$ 50\% were set as requirements for sufficient accuracy. Based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach, the quality of evidence across studies was rated for each index method. Renal clearance of iothalamate measured GFR with sufficient accuracy (strong evidence). Renal and plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA and plasma clearance of iohexol were sufficiently accurate to measure GFR (moderately strong evidence). Renal clearance of DTPA, renal clearance of iohexol, and plasma clearance of inulin had sufficient accuracy (limited evidence). Endogenous creatinine clearance was an inaccurate method (strong evidence), as was plasma clearance of DTPA (limited evidence). The evidence to determine the accuracy of plasma iothalamate clearance was insufficient. With the exception of plasma clearance of inulin, only renal clearance methods had P30 . 90\%. Limitations: The included studies were few and most were old and small, which may limit generalizability. Requirements for sufficient accuracy may depend on clinical setting. Conclusions: At least moderately strong evidence suggests that renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA or iothalamate and plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA or iohexol are sufficiently accurate methods to measure GFR.

  abstract = {The crisis of antibiotic-resistant infections continues to escalate unabated, and development of new antibiotics is not keeping pace. The causes of and solutions to the antibiotic market failure have been documented extensively. Scientific, economic, and regulatory challenges have combined to cause this failure, and only a coordinated series of policies designed to change the economics of antibiotic development and make clinical development feasible, sensible, and patientcentric (rather than statistics-centric) is likely to revive the pipeline. Meanwhile, advances in infection prevention, antibiotic stewardship, and the science of treating infections (e.g., disarming pathogens and modulating host inflammation) are also needed.7,11 Top areas of unmet medical need include the treatment of XDR and PDR GNB infection, treatment of common community-onset infections such as UTIs and intra-abdominal infections caused by GNB resistant to all oral options, XDR/ PDR tuberculosis, bloodstream and bone infections caused by MRSA, and XDR/ PDR gonorrhea.},

Influencing human behaviour in relation to antibiotics is a complex process which includes factors like knowledge, attitudes, social norms, socio-economic conditions, peer pressure, experiences, and bio-physical and sociobehavioural environment. Further, key concepts are often perceived in different ways by different individuals. While designing and implementing projects or programmes for behavioural change with respect to antibiotics for professionals or consumers it is helpful to consider theories or models of behaviour change, e.g. the `stages of change model', including pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. People in different stages of change are susceptible to different behaviour modification strategies. Application of marketing principles to `global good', so-called `social marketing', to improve `welfare of the individual and society' is gaining increased attention in public health. In conclusion, just providing correct knowledge is not sufficient although it is a pre-requisite for behaviour modification in the desired direction. We can never change the behaviour of any other human, but we can facilitate for others to change their own behaviour. One possibility is to implement `antibiotic mainstreaming' as a potentially effective way for behaviour modification, i.e. to address consequences for maintaining effective antibiotics in all activities and decisions in society.},

  abstract = {Background: Variation in performance of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimating equations is related to variation in calibration of the creatinine assay across clinical laboratories. Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Setting \& Participants: 6 research studies and 4 clinical populations including 5,504 participants who had GFR measured using urinary clearance of iothalamate. Measurements: Standardized serum creatinine values obtained by means of calibration to the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory using frozen specimens, a calibration panel, and/or survey results from the College of American Pathologists. Predictor: Noncalibrated serum creatinine assayed in research and clinical laboratories compared with standardized serum creatinine. Outcome: Difference between measured GFR versus GFR estimated from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study and Cockcroft-Gault equations. Results: For a noncalibrated serum creatinine value of 1 mg/dL (88.4 ␮mol/L), standardized serum creatinine value was 0.07 mg/dL (6.2 ␮mol/L) less than noncalibrated values. In the pooled data set, for the MDRD Study equation, calibration improved median percentage of difference between measured and estimated GFR from 9.0\% (interquartile range [IQR], 28\%) to 5.8\% (IQR, 28\%) and improved the percentage of estimates within 30\% of measured GFR (P30) from 80\% to 83\%. The effect of calibration was greater at higher levels of GFR and varied across studies. For the Cockcroft-Gault equation, calibration worsened the median percentage of difference from Ϫ2.0\% (IQR, 38\%) to Ϫ11.4\% (IQR, 39\%), and the P30, from 74\% to 69\%. Limitations: College of American Pathologist samples were used for calibration of clinical populations; calibration factors do not account for drift over time in the serum creatinine assay; calibration cannot account for variation in assay performance among individuals. Conclusion: Calibration improves the performance of the MDRD Study equation. After calibration, larger errors remain for GFR estimates greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Ͼ1 mL/s/1.73 m2).

This article tries to explore the various methods available to date, the newer concepts, and the uncared issues that may still prove to be useful in estimating renal function in intensive care unit patients. The concept of augmented renal clearance, which is frequently encountered in critically ill patients, should always be taken into account, as correct therapeutic dosage of drugs sounds vital which in turn depends on correctly calculated glomerular filtration rate. Serum creatinine and creatinine-based formulae have their own demerits that are well known and established. While Cockcroft-Gault and 4-variable modification of diet in renal diseases formulae are highly inadequate in the intensive care setup for estimating glomerular filtration rate, employing isotopic methods is impractical and cumbersome. The 6-variable modification of diet in renal diseases formula fairs better as it takes into account the serum albumin and blood urea nitrogen, too. Jelliffe's and modified Jelliffe's equations take into account the rate of creatinine production and volume of distribution which in turn fluctuates heavily in a critically ill patient. Twenty-four-hour and timed creatinine clearances offer values close to reality although not accurate and cannot provide immediate results. Cystatin C is a novel agent that offers a sure promise as it is least influenced by factors that affect serum creatinine to a major extent. Aminoglycoside clearance, although still in the dark area, may prove a simple yet precise way of estimating glomerular filtration rate in those patients in whom these drugs are therapeutically employed. Optic ratiometric method has emerged as the most sophisticated one in glomerular filtration rate estimation in critically ill patients.},

Bedaquiline is a novel drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB; combined use with antiretroviral drugs, nevirapine, or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) is anticipated, but no clinical data from coinfected patients are available. Plasma concentrations of bedaquiline and its M2 metabolite after single doses were obtained from interaction studies with nevirapine or LPV/r in healthy volunteers. The antiretrovirals' effects on bedaquiline and M2 pharmacokinetics were assessed by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Potential dose adjustments were evaluated with simulations. No significant effects of nevirapine on bedaquiline pharmacokinetics were identified. LPV/r decreased bedaquiline and M2 clearances to 35\% (relative standard error [RSE], 9.2\%) and 58\% (RSE, 8.4\%), respectively, of those without comedication. As almost 3-fold (bedaquiline) and 2-fold (M2) increases in exposures during chronic treatment with LPV/r are expected, dose adjustments are suggested for evaluation. Efficacious, safe bedaquiline dosing for MDR-TB patients receiving antiretrovirals is important. Modeling results suggest that bedaquiline can be coadministered with nevirapine without dose adjustments. The predicted elevation of bedaquiline and M2 levels during LPV/r coadministration may be a safety concern, and careful monitoring is recommended. Further data are being collected in coinfected patients to determine whether dose adjustments are needed.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Safe, effective concomitant treatment regimens for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV infection are urgently needed. Bedaquiline (BDQ) is a promising new anti-TB drug, and efavirenz (EFV) is a commonly used antiretroviral. Due to EFV's induction of cytochrome P450 3A4, the metabolic enzyme responsible for BDQ biotransformation, the drugs are expected to interact. Based on data from a phase I, single-dose pharmacokinetic study, a nonlinear mixed-effects model characterizing BDQ pharmacokinetics and interaction with multiple-dose EFV was developed. BDQ pharmacokinetics were best described by a 3-compartment disposition model with absorption through a dynamic transit compartment model. Metabolites M2 and M3 were described by 2-compartment models with clearance of BDQ and M2, respectively, as input. Impact of induction was described as an instantaneous change in clearance 1 week after initialization of EFV treatment and estimated for all compounds. The model predicts average steady-state concentrations of BDQ and M2 to be reduced by 52\% (relative standard error [RSE], 3.7\%) with chronic coadministration. A range of models with alternative structural assumptions regarding onset of induction effect and fraction metabolized resulted in similar estimates of the typical reduction and did not offer a markedly better fit to data. Simulations to investigate alternative regimens mitigating the estimated interaction effect were performed. The results suggest that simple adjustments of the standard regimen during EFV coadministration can prevent reduced exposure to BDQ without increasing exposures to M2. However, exposure to M3 would increase. Evaluation in clinical trials of adjusted regimens is necessary to ensure appropriate dosing for HIV-infected TB patients on an EFV-based regimen.},

This work aimed to explore the possibility of using the existing tablet formulation in children by evaluating the relative bioavailability, short-term safety, acceptability and palatability of suspended bedaquiline tablets compared to whole tablets. METHODS: A randomized, open-label, two-period cross-over study was conducted in 24 healthy adult volunteers. Rich pharmacokinetic sampling over 48~h was conducted at two occasions 14~days apart in each participant after administration of 400~mg bedaquiline (whole or suspended in water). The pharmacokinetic data were analysed with nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. A questionnaire was used to assess palatability and acceptability. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the bioavailability of the suspended bedaquiline tables compared to whole. The nonparametric 95\% confidence interval of the relative bioavailability of suspended bedaquiline tablets was 94-108\% of that of whole bedaquiline tablets; hence, the predefined bioequivalence criteria were fulfilled. There were no Grade 3 or 4 or serious treatment emergent adverse events recorded in the study and no apparent differences between whole tablets and suspension regarding taste, texture or smell. CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability of bedaquiline tablets suspended in water was the same as for tablets swallowed whole and the suspension was well tolerated. This suggests that the currently available bedaquiline formulation could be used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in children, to bridge the gap between when paediatric dosing regimens have been established and when a paediatric dispersible formulation is routinely available.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work was to facilitate the development of nonlinear mixed effects models by establishing a diagnostic method for evaluation of stochastic model components. The random effects investigated were between subject, between occasion and residual variability. The method was based on a first-order conditional estimates linear approximation and evaluated on three real datasets with previously developed population pharmacokinetic models. The results were assessed based on the agreement in difference in objective function value between a basic model and extended models for the standard nonlinear and linearized approach respectively. The linearization was found to accurately identify significant extensions of the model's stochastic components with notably decreased runtimes as compared to the standard nonlinear analysis. The observed gain in runtimes varied between four to more than 50-fold and the largest gains were seen for models with originally long runtimes. This method may be especially useful as a screening tool to detect correlations between random effects since it substantially quickens the estimation of large variance--covariance blocks. To expedite the application of this diagnostic tool, the linearization procedure has been automated and implemented in the software package PsN.},

  abstract = {Combination antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative sepsis is controversial. The present review provides a brief summary of the existing knowledge on combination therapy for severe infections with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterobacteriaceae. Empirical combination antibiotic therapy is recommended for severe sepsis and septic shock to reduce mortality related to inappropriate antibiotic treatment. Because definitive combination therapy has not been proven superior to monotherapy in meta-analyses, it is generally advised to de-escalate antibiotic therapy when the antibiotic susceptibility profile is known, although it cannot be excluded that some subgroups of patients might still benefit from continued combination therapy. Definitive combination therapy is recommended for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and should also be considered for severe infections with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. when beta-lactams cannot be used. Because resistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams is increasing in Gram-negative bacteria and because no new antibiotics are expected to become available in the near future, the antibacterial potential of combination therapy should be further explored. In vitro data suggest that combinations can be effective even if the bacteria are resistant to the individual antibiotics, although existing evidence is insufficient to support the choice of combinations and explain the synergistic effects observed. In vitro models can be used to screen for effective combinations that can later be validated in animal or clinical studies. Further, in the absence of clinical evidence, in vitro data might be useful in supporting therapeutic decisions for severe infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.},

  abstract = {Pilot studies for phase III trials - which are comparative randomized trials designed to provide preliminary evidence on the clinical efficacy of a drug or intervention - are routinely performed in many clinical areas. Also commonly know as ``feasibility'' or ``vanguard'' studies, they are designed to assess the safety of treatment or interventions; to assess recruitment potential; to assess the feasibility of international collaboration or coordination for multicentre trials; to increase clinical experience with the study medication or intervention for the phase III trials. They are the best way to assess feasibility of a large, expensive full-scale study, and in fact are an almost essential pre-requisite. Conducting a pilot prior to the main study can enhance the likelihood of success of the main study and potentially help to avoid doomed main studies. The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed examination of the key aspects of pilot studies for phase III trials including: 1) the general reasons for conducting a pilot study; 2) the relationships between pilot studies, proof-of-concept studies, and adaptive designs; 3) the challenges of and misconceptions about pilot studies; 4) the criteria for evaluating the success of a pilot study; 5) frequently asked questions about pilot studies; 7) some ethical aspects related to pilot studies; and 8) some suggestions on how to report the results of pilot investigations using the CONSORT format.},

  abstract = {Normal human red blood cells have an average life span of about 120 days in the circulation after which they are engulfed by macrophages. This is an extremely efficient process as macrophages phagocytose about 5 million erythrocytes every second without any significant release of hemoglobin in the circulation. Despite large number of investigations, the precise molecular mechanism by which macrophages recognize senescent red blood cells for clearance remains elusive. Red cells undergo several physicochemical changes as they age in the circulation. Several of these changes have been proposed as a recognition tag for macrophages. Most prevalent hypotheses for red cell clearance mechanism(s) are expression of neoantigens on red cell surface, exposure phosphatidylserine and decreased deformability. While there is some correlation between these changes with aging their causal role for red cell clearance has not been established. Despite plethora of investigations, we still have incomplete understanding of the molecular details of red cell clearance. In this review, we have reviewed the recent data on clearance of senescent red cells. We anticipate recent progresses in               in vivo               red cell labeling and the explosion of modern proteomic techniques will, in near future, facilitate our understanding of red cell senescence and their destruction.},

  abstract = {Therapeutic neutralization of Oncostatin M (OSM) causes mechanism-driven anemia and thrombocytopenia, which narrows the therapeutic window complicating the selection of doses (and dosing intervals) that optimize efficacy and safety. We utilized clinical data from studies of an anti-OSM monoclonal antibody (GSK2330811) in healthy volunteers (               n               \,=\,49) and systemic sclerosis patients (               n               \,=\,35), to quantitatively determine the link between OSM and alterations in red blood cell (RBC) and platelet production. Longitudinal changes in hematopoietic variables (including RBCs, reticulocytes, platelets, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin) were linked in a physiology-based model, to capture the long-term effects and variability of therapeutic OSM neutralization on human hematopoiesis. Free serum OSM stimulated precursor cell production through sigmoidal relations, with higher maximum suppression (I               max               ) and OSM concentration for 50\% suppression (IC               50               ) for platelets (89.1\% [95\% confidence interval: 83.4--93.0], 6.03\,pg/mL [4.41--8.26]) than RBCs (57.0\% [49.7--64.0], 2.93\,pg/mL [2.55--3.36]). Reduction in hemoglobin and platelets increased erythro- and thrombopoietin, respectively, prompting reticulocytosis and (partially) alleviating OSM-restricted hematopoiesis. The physiology-based model was substantiated by preclinical data and utilized in exploration of once-weekly or every other week dosing regimens. Predictions revealed an (for the indication) unacceptable occurrence of grade 2 (67\% [58--76], 29\% [20--38]) and grade 3 (17\% [10--25], 3\% [0--7]) anemias, with limited thrombocytopenia. Individual extent of RBC precursor modulation was moderately correlated to skin mRNA gene expression changes. The physiological basis and consideration of interplay among hematopoietic variables makes the model generalizable to other drug and nondrug scenarios, with adaptations for patient populations, diseases, and therapeutics that modulate hematopoiesis or exhibit risk of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia.},

Unfortunately, universally accepted endpoints for the evaluation of new drugs in severe infections are lacking. Methods:{\enspace} We review and discuss the current practices and challenges regarding endpoints in RCTs in this field and propose novel approaches. Results:{\enspace} Usual endpoints actually recommended for drug development suffer from important flaws. Mortality requires large sample size and only partly related to the infectious process. Clinical cure rate is highly subjective in critically ill patients where symptoms may be related to other intercurrent events. Currently, composite endpoints, hierarchical nested designs, and competing risks analysis seem to be the most promising new tools for designing and analyzing clinical trials in this area, although they require further validation. Conclusion:{\enspace} Regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical companies, and clinicians need to agree on the most appropri-ate clinical endpoints for severe infections to ensure efficient approval of new, effective antibiotic agents.},

There is a need to tackle antibiotic resistance emergence and containment on levels ranging from individuals, households, and the communities, to health care facilities, the entire health sector, and finally to national and global levels. We analyse emergence of antibiotic resistance based on interdependencies between health systems resources. We further go beyond the health system building blocks, to look at determinants of antibiotic resistance referring to wider global dynamics. Multi-level governance is the key for successful action in containment strategies. This will involve, in a comprehensive way, patients, health facilities where they receive care, health systems to which these facilities pertain, and the wider national context as well as the global community that influences the functioning of these health systems. In order to be effective and sustainable in both high and low-resource settings, implementation of containment interventions at all these levels needs to be managed based on existing theories and models of change. Although ministries of health and the global community must provide vision and support, it is important to keep in mind that containment interventions for antibiotic resistance will target individuals, consumers as well as providers.},

The improvement is based on an approximation of the logarithm of the error function. After presenting the derivation of the improved implementation, the article compares the performance of the algorithm to a naive implementation of the log-likelihood using both simulations and a real data example. In the simulation setting, the improved algorithm yielded more precise and less biased parameter estimates when the within-subject variability was small and estimation was performed using the Laplace algorithm. The estimation results did not differ between implementations when the SAEM algorithm was used. For the real data example, bootstrap results differed between implementations with the improved implementation producing identical or better objective function values. Based on the findings in this article, the improved implementation is suggested as the new default log-likelihood implementation for the bounded integer model.},

However, drug concentrations at the infection site drive antimicrobial effect, and efficacy predictions and dosing strategies should be based on these concentrations. We set out to review different translational pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) approaches from a target site perspective. The most common approach involves calculating the probability of attaining animal-derived PK/PD index targets, which link PK parameters to antimicrobial susceptibility measures. This approach is time efficient but ignores some aspects of the shape of the PK profile and inter-species differences in drug clearance and distribution, and provides no information on the PD time-course. Time--kill curves, in contrast, depict bacterial response over time. In vitro dynamic time--kill setups allow for the evaluation of bacterial response to clinical PK profiles, but are not representative of the infection site environment. The translational value of in vivo time--kill experiments, conversely, is limited from a PK perspective. Computational PK/PD models, especially when developed using both in vitro and in vivo data and coupled to target site PK models, can bridge translational gaps in both PK and PD. Ultimately, clinical PK and experimental and computational tools should be combined to tailor antibiotic treatment strategies to the site of infection.},

Modeling is performed at the level of the hazard function describing the instantaneous rate of an event occurring at that timepoint. We give an overview of the parametric time-to-event analysis starting with graphical exploration by Kaplan--Meier plotting for the event data including censoring and nonparametric hazard estimators such as the kernel-based visual hazard comparison for the underlying hazard. The most common hazard functions including the exponential, Gompertz, Weibull, log-normal, log-logistic, and circadian functions are described in detail. A Shiny application was developed to graphically guide the modeler which of the most common hazard functions presents a similar shape compared to the data in order to guide which hazard functions to test in the parametric time-to-event analysis. For the chosen hazard function(s), the Shiny application can additionally be used to explore corresponding parameter values to inform on suitable initial estimates for parametric modeling as well as on possible covariate or treatment relationships to certain parameters. Moreover, it can be used for the dissemination of results as well as communication, training, and workshops on time-to-event analysis. By guiding the modeler on which functions and what parameter values to test and compare as well as to assist in dissemination, the Shiny application developed here greatly supports the modeler in complicated parametric time-to-event modeling.},

  abstract = {Clinical trials rarely, if ever, occur in a vacuum. Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study's control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., `borrowing') this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of `dynamic' (versus `static') borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners.},

In addition, models with homogenous or heterogeneous residual error were used to demonstrate the relationship between the objective functions derived from two different types of approximation, namely Laplacian approximation of log-likelihood and linearized model approximation. The relationship between these estimation methods and those implemented in SAS and Splus is discussed.},

  abstract = {Rating and composite scales are commonly used to assess treatment efficacy. The two main strategies for modelling such endpoints are to treat them as a continuous or an ordered categorical variable (CV or OC). Both strategies have disadvantages, including making assumptions that violate the integer nature of the data (CV) and requiring many parameters for scales with many response categories (OC). We present a method, called the bounded integer (BI) model, which utilises the probit function with fixed cut-offs to estimate the probability of a certain score through a latent variable. This method was successfully implemented to describe six data sets from four different therapeutic areas: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain. Five scales were investigated, ranging from 11 to 181 categories. The fit (likelihood) was better for the BI model than for corresponding OC or CV models ({$\Delta$}AIC range 11--1555) in all cases but one ({$\Delta$}AIC - 63), while the number of parameters was the same or lower. Markovian elements were successfully implemented within the method. The performance in external validation, assessed through cross-validation, was also in favour of the new model ({$\Delta$}OFV range 22--1694) except in one case ({$\Delta$}OFV - 70). A residual for diagnostic purposes is discussed. This study shows that the BI model respects the integer nature of data and is parsimonious in terms of number of estimated parameters.},

The analysis method that most fully uses the information gathered is item response theory (IRT) models, but these are complex and require item-level data which may not be available. Therefore, the TS is commonly analysed with standard continuous variable (CV) models, which do not respect the bounded nature of data. Bounded integer (BI) models do respect the data nature but are not as extensively researched. Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) are an alternative that requires few assumptions and handles dropout without bias. If an IRT model exists, the expected mean and standard deviation of TS can be computed through IRT-informed functions---which allows CV and BI models to estimate parameters on the IRT scale. The fit, performance on external data and parameter precision (when applicable) of CV, BI and MMRM to analyse simulated TS data from the MDS-UPDRS motor subscale are investigated in this work. All models provided accurate predictions and residuals without trends, but the fit of CV and BI models was improved by IRT-informed functions. The IRT-informed BI model had more precise parameter estimates than the IRT-informed CV model. The IRT-informed models also had the best performance on external data, while the MMRM model was worst. In conclusion, (1) IRT-informed functions improve TS analyses and (2) IRT-informed BI models had more precise IRT parameter estimates than IRT-informed CV models.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Composite scale data is widely used in many therapeutic areas and consists of several categorical questions/items that are usually summarized into a total score (TS). Such data is discrete and bounded by nature. The gold standard to analyse composite scale data is item response theory (IRT) models. However, IRT models require item-level data while sometimes only TS is available. This work investigates models for TS. When an IRT model exists, it can be used to derive the information as well as expected mean and variability of TS at any point, which can inform TS-analyses. We propose a new method: IRT-informed functions of expected values and standard deviation in TS-analyses. The most common models for TS-analyses are continuous variable (CV) models, while bounded integer (BI) models offer an alternative that respects scale boundaries and the nature of TS data. We investigate the method in CV and BI models on both simulated and real data. Both CV and BI models were improved in fit by IRT-informed disease progression, which allows modellers to precisely and accurately find the corresponding latent variable parameters, and IRT-informed SD, which allows deviations from homoscedasticity. The methodology provides a formal way to link IRT models and TS models, and to compare the relative information of different model types. Also, joint analyses of item-level data and TS data are made possible. Thus, IRT-informed functions can facilitate total score analysis and allow a quantitative analysis of relative merits of different analysis methods.},

In the last years, we have examined murine erythropoiesis, thrombopoiesis, granulopoiesis, and stem cell hemopoiesis by means of mathematical modeling in order to identify some of the underlying principles. Our results can be summarized in four hypotheses. 1) The regulation of hemopoiesis is governed by three interrelated control loops: autoregulation of stem cells, feedback from progenitors and precursors to the stem cells, and feedback from mature cells to progenitor and precursor cells. 2) The feedback from mature cells to the progenitor and precursor cells predominantly varies the number of cell divisions taking place during hemopoietic maturation. 3) Two distinct properties of the stem cells are regulated: their cyclic activity and their self-renewal. Both are under the control of stem cell autoregulation and the feedback from progenitors and precursors. 4) A large variance in the maturation time from the stem cells to the mature cells stabilizes the hemopoietic control. The mathematical formulation of these assumptions allows us to understand a broad range of experimental observations including recovery from stem cell damage, hypoproliferative and hyperproliferative situations, and interactions between different cell lines.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Proper handling of data below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) is crucial for accurate pharmacokinetic parameter estimation. The M3 method proposed by Beal uses a likelihood-based approach that is precise but has been reported to suffer from numerical issues in converging. Common alternatives include ignoring the BLQs (M1), imputing half of the lower limit of quantification and ignoring trailing BLQs (M6) or imputing zero (M7). The imputation methods fail to account for the additional uncertainty affecting imputed observations. We used NONMEM with FOCE-I/Laplace to compare the stability, bias, and precision of methods M1, M3, M6, M7, and modified versions M6+ and M7+ that inflate the additive residual error for BLQs. Real and simulated datasets with a two-compartment model were used to assess stability through parallel retries with perturbed initial estimates. The resulting differences in objective function values (OFV) were compared. Bias and precision were evaluated on simulated data using stochastic simulations and estimations. M3 yielded different OFV across retries ({\textpm}14.7), though the parameter estimates were similar. All other methods, except M7 ({\textpm}130), were stable. M3 demonstrated the best bias and precision (average rRMSE 18.7\%), but M6+ and M7+ performed comparably (26.0\% and 23.3\%, respectively). The unstable OFV produced by M3 represents a challenge when used to guide model development. Imputation methods showed superior stability, and including inflated additive error improved bias and precision to levels comparable with M3. For these reasons, M7+ (of simpler implementation than M6+) is an attractive alternative to M3, especially during model development.},

They are suitable for both biomedical and other applications in which time-toevent variables are analyzed. However, they are still not frequently applied. So far, an important reason for this has been the lack of available software. To overcome this problem, we have developed the mstate package in R for the analysis of multi-state models. The package covers all steps of the analysis of multi-state models, from model building and data preparation to estimation and graphical representation of the results. It can be applied to non- and semi-parametric (Cox) models. The package is also suitable for competing risks models, as they are a special category of multi-state models.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The study compared estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) between the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation and the Jelliffe, Chiou, and Brater equations designed for estimation in dynamic renal function and resulting antimicrobial dosing concordance of five antimicrobials (cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and fluconazole) commonly used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Electronic medical records were used to identify the target patient population. Analysis of variance tests with repeated measures were performed to compare eCrCl. Bowker's tests of symmetry were applied to compare the dosing regimen discordance between CG and candidate equations. Results: From January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2012, we identified 387 patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), among whom 62\% (n = 240) were older adults (65 years and older) and 46\% (n = 178) were obese (body mass index {$\geq$}30). In the declining phase of renal function, eCrCl means were different between the CG and Brater equations (32.0 vs 26.1 mL/min, P {$<$} 0.001). The dosing regimen discordance rates (CG vs candidate equations) in declining renal function varied from 19.3\% to 25\% and were statistically significant for cefepime and meropenem (P {$<$} 0.001) based on Food and Drug Administration recommendations for dose adjustment. In the improving phase, eCrCl means were different (P {$<$} 0.001) between CG (43.0 mL/min) and candidate formulas (Brater 47.9, Chiou 31.7, and Jelliffe 55.3 mL/min). The dosing regimen discordance rates (CG vs candidate equations) in the improving phase varied from 8.3\% to 39\% and were statistically significant for all 5 antimicrobials (P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: Differences in eCrCl between CG and candidate formulas were observed in surgical ICU patients with acute kidney injury. Discordant dosing recommendations may affect antimicrobial regimens in ICU patients with dynamic renal function.},

  abstract = {Covariate analysis based on population pharmacokinetics (PPK) is used to identify clinically relevant factors. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) based on nonlinear mixed effect model fits is currently recommended for covariate identification, whereas individual empirical Bayesian estimates (EBEs) are considered unreliable due to the presence of shrinkage. The objectives of this research were to investigate the type I error for LRT and EBE approaches, to confirm the similarity of power between the LRT and EBE approaches from a previous report and to explore the influence of shrinkage on LRT and EBE inferences. Using an oral one-compartment PK model with a single covariate impacting on clearance, we conducted a wide range of simulations according to a two-way factorial design. The results revealed that the EBE-based regression not only provided almost identical power for detecting a covariate effect, but also controlled the false positive rate better than the LRT approach. Shrinkage of EBEs is likely not the root cause for decrease in power or inflated false positive rate although the size of the covariate effect tends to be underestimated at high shrinkage. In summary, contrary to the current recommendations, EBEs may be a better choice for statistical tests in PPK covariate analysis compared to LRT. We proposed a threestep covariate modeling approach for population PK analysis to utilize the advantages of EBEs while overcoming their shortcomings, which allows not only markedly reducing the run time for population PK analysis, but also providing more accurate covariate tests.},

  abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is becoming an increasing threat, with too few novel antibiotics coming to market to replace those lost due to resistance development. Efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for and design novel antibacterials have not been successful, with several companies minimizing or closing down their antibacterial research units, leading to a loss of skills and know-how. At the same time, antibiotic innovation in academia is not filling the void due to misaligned incentive structures and lack of vital knowledge of drug discovery. The scientific and structural difficulties in discovering new antibiotics have only begun to be appreciated in the latest years. Part of the problem has been a paradigm shift within both industry and academia to focus on `rational' drug development with an emphasis on single targets and high-throughput screening of large chemical libraries, which may not be suited to target bacteria. The very particular aspects of `targeting an organism inside another organism' have not been given enough attention. In this paper, researcher interviews have complemented literature studies to delve deeper into the specifics of the different scientific and structural barriers, and some potential solutions are offered.},
