Pediatric (chronological) age groups:

* Neonates: birth–⁠27 days (corrected gestational age*)
* Infants: 28 days–1 years
* Children: 2–5 years
* Children: 6–12 years
* Adolescents 13–⁠17 years
* Adults: 18+ years

`Corrected gestational age[weeks] = PNA[weeks] - (40 - GA[weeks])`

![Pediatric age. PMA, post-menstrual age; D1, first day of last menstrual period; GA, gestational age; W, weeks; PNA, post-natal age](pediatric-age.png)

Renal maturation [Rhodin et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-008-0997-5):

`maturation = PMA**Hill / (TM_50**Hill + PMA**Hill)`

The maturation half-life (TM_50) is fixed to the literature value of 47.7 weeks and the
Hill exponent to the value of 3.4 (both from Rhodin et al.).
The distribution (mean, [min-max]) of PMA (weeks) in this study population was (518, [57-1652]).
Assuming that the time to reach 50% of the maximum renal maturation could be different in pre-term infants, a different value for TM_50 could be estimated for pre-term neonates, if the current model does not describes this sub-group well.
