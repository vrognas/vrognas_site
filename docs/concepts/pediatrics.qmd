Pediatric (chronological) age groups:

* Neonates: birth–⁠27 days (corrected gestational age*)
* Infants: 28 days–1 years
* Children: 2–5 years
* Children: 6–12 years
* Adolescents 13–⁠17 years
* Adults: 18+ years

$$\text{Corrected gestational age}_\text{weeks} = \text{PNA}_\text{weeks} - (40 - \text{GA}_\text{weeks})$$

![Pediatric age. PMA, post-menstrual age; D1, first day of last menstrual period; GA, gestational age; W, weeks; PNA, post-natal age](pediatric-age.png)

Renal maturation [Rhodin et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-008-0997-5):

$$\text{maturation} = \text{PMA}^\text{Hill} / (\text{TM}_{50}^\text{Hill}\text{ + \text{PMA}^\text{Hill})$$

The maturation half-life ($\text{TM}_{50}$) is fixed to the literature value of 47.7 weeks and the
Hill-exponent to the value of 3.4 (both from Rhodin et al.).
The distribution (mean, [min-max]) of PMA (weeks) in this study population was (518, [57-1652]).
Assuming that the time to reach 50% of the maximum renal maturation could be different in pre-term infants, a different value for $\text{TM}_{50}$ could be estimated for pre-term neonates, if the current model does not describes this sub-group well.

If an indication can be assumed to behave similarly in an adult and a pediatric population, PK extrapolation can be used.
Pediatric exposure should then be comparable to adult exposure.
