The use of model informed drug development (MIDD) approaches in pediatric drug development is highly recommended due to:

* Practical and ethical limitations in data collection.
* Ability to quantify the effects of growth and maturation by leveraging data from literature and older patients.

The most relevant covariate to influence PK in pediatric patients is considered to be **body weight** accounting for size differences, in addition to **age** (@fig-age) in the youngest pediatric patients to account for maturation of drug eliminating processes (see @eq-maturation).

Relevant predefined exposure metrics should be presented graphically versus body weight and age on a continuous scale (@fig-cov).
If the drug is indicated to be used in the age range below one year, exposure vs body weight and age should be depicted in an additional separate figure focused on children 0--1 year of age.

![Predicted C~ss~ by **body weight (*left*)** and **age (*right*)** using the final pediatric population PK model (*red circles*: individual predictions) for children from the NHANES database using 2 mg/kg BID for patients <8 years, and 1.6 mg/kg BID for patients ≥8 years with 100 mg BID maximum dose (*top*), or 2 mg/kg BID with 100 mg BID maximum dose for all patients (*bottom*). The *blue line* is the median simulated pediatric C~ss~ and the *blue shaded area* encompasses 90% of the simulated paediatric patients. The *horizontal grey band* encompasses 90% of the simulated adult patients receiving 100 mg BID. [Schoemaker et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00228-017-2230-6).](pediatric-cov.png){#fig-cov}

If different doses are proposed for bands of weight or/and age, exposure ranges predicted for the proposed doses for the subsets of the pediatric population should be visualized as boxplots (@fig-box).
The reference range in the adult population (median and outer percentiles of observed or simulated data) should be given additionally (@fig-box).
The same statistics should be presented numerically in tables.

Approximate pediatric (chronologial) age groups:

* Neonates: birth--27 days (corrected gestational age, @eq-cga)
    * Preterm
    * Term
* Infants: 28 days--1 year
* Early childhood: 2--5 years
* Middle childhood: 6--11 years
* Adolescents 12--⁠17 years
    * PK often similar to adults
* Adults: >18 years
    * Acts as reference

:::{.callout-note}
A pediatric patient that is 17.9 years old belongs to the adolescent age group, until the 18^th^ birthday.

\text{Corrected gestational age}_\text{weeks} = \text{PNA}_\text{weeks} - (40 - \text{GA}_\text{weeks})
$$ {#eq-cga}

Renal maturation, [Rhodin et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-008-0997-5):

$$
\text{maturation} = \text{PMA}^\text{Hill} / (\text{TM}_{50}^\text{Hill} + \text{PMA}^\text{Hill})
$$ {#eq-maturation}

The maturation half-life (TM~50~) is fixed to the literature value of 47.7 weeks and the Hill-exponent to the value of 3.4 (both from Rhodin et al.).
The distribution (mean, [min--max]) of PMA (weeks) in this study population was (518, [57--1652]).
Assuming renal maturation time differs in pre-term infants, a separate TM~50~ value could be estimated for them if the current model poorly describes this subgroup.

## Extrapolation

If an indication can be assumed to behave similarly in an adult and a pediatric population, PK extrapolation ("bridging") can be used.
This is a clinical question, and there could be cicumstances where a dedicated pediatric study is warranted (e.g. safety concerns or clinical presentation of the disease).

The relevant PK metric(s) linked to efficacy and safety and the exposure-response relationship should first be established in adults.
Pediatric PK should then be comparable to adult PK.

The plan is to predict exposure in a pediatric age group, collect data, refine predictions for the next younger group, and repeat.
The extrapolation generally includes a population PK model and exposure response models.
These models may be independent from the adult models if there's adequate data, or they may be developed in combination with the adult data.

### Allometry

A previously developed adult PK model can be extrapolated to pediatric patients using allometry, which relates volume of distribution and clearance to body size.
Volume of distribution scales proportionally with body size (@lst-v), while clearance scales less proportionally (@lst-cl).

```verilog {#lst-v}
TVV = THETA(1)
V = TVV * (WT/70)**1
```

```verilog {#lst-cl}
TVCL = THETA(1)
CL = TVV * (WT/70)**0.75
```

This theory has been studied and applied with various animal species and human subjects across a wide range of compounds.
With the exception of some targeted therapies and large molecule biologics, the theory has proven to be robust and reliable.

::: {.callout-tip title="Fix exponents, or estimate?"}
Fix exponents if you don't have pediatric PK data.
Fix AND estimate them if you *have* pediatric PK data.
:::

In neonates the maturation level of eliminating organs influences the estimates and in adults the body composition will affect them.
Data from pediatric development programs are often too limited to confirm whether allometric exponents differ from theoretical values.
MSWP considers the use of fixed exponents both scientifically justified and practical when developing popPK models in children.

::: {.callout-important}
Don't use allometric exponents estimated using adult data for pediatric PK models.
:::

In lower ages (**< 2 years**) there are also maturation functions (@eq-maturation) that come into play.
For these pediatric patients it is **important to include maturation function(s)** to describe pediatric PK.

Due to high correlation between body weight and age in pediatric patients, **maturation functions and allometric exponents should not be estimated simultaneously** ([Bonate (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1018828709196)).

### Method

In pediatric patients, we want to start with a **clinically relevant dose**.
