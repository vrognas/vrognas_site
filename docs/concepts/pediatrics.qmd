title: "Pediatric extrapolation"
---

The use of model informed drug development (MIDD) approaches in pediatric drug development is highly recommended due to:

* Practical and ethical limitations in data collection.
* Ability to quantify the effects of growth and maturation by leveraging data from literature and older patients.

If an indication can be assumed to behave similarly in an adult and a pediatric population, PK extrapolation ("bridging") can be used.
This is a clinical question, and there could be cicumstances where a dedicated pediatric study is warranted (e.g. safety concerns or clinical presentation of the disease).

The relevant PK metric(s) linked to efficacy and safety and the exposure-response relationship should first be established in adults.
In pediatric patients, we want to start with a **clinically relevant dose**.
Pediatric PK should then be comparable to adult PK.

The plan is to predict exposure in a pediatric age group, collect data, refine predictions for the next younger group, and repeat.
The extrapolation generally includes a population PK model and exposure response models.
These models may be independent from the adult models if there's adequate data, or they may be developed in combination with the adult data.

## Allometric scaling

A previously developed adult PK model can be extrapolated to pediatric patients using allometry, which relates volume of distribution and clearance to body size.
Volume of distribution scales proportionally with body size (@lst-v), while clearance scales less proportionally (@lst-cl).
Allometric scaling should not be used on rate constants.
Researchers have studied and applied this theory across various animal species and human subjects using a wide range of compounds.
It has proven robust and reliable, except in some targeted therapies and large molecule biologics.

### Step 1: Refit the Final Adult Data with Allometric Exponents

Scale each volume parameter, including central volume and peripheral volumes.

```verilog {#lst-v lst-cap="Allometric scaling for Volume"}
V1 = THETA(1) * EXP(ETA(1))
V1 = V1 * (WT / 70)**1 ; Allometric scaling

V2 = THETA(2) * EXP(ETA(2))
V2 = V2 * (WT / 70)**1 ; Allometric scaling
```
Scale each clearance parameter, including total clearance (CL) and inter-compartmental clearance values such as Q.

```verilog {#lst-cl lst-cap="Allometric scaling for Clearance"}
CL = THETA(1) * EXP(ETA(1))
CL = CL * (WT / 70)**0.75 ; Allometric scaling

Q = THETA(2) * EXP(ETA(2))
Q = Q * (WT / 70)**0.75 ; Allometric scaling
```

::: {.callout-note title="Fix exponents, or estimate?"}
Fix exponents if you don't have pediatric PK data.
Fix AND estimate them if you *have* pediatric PK data.
Do a sensitivity analysis: How do the exposure predictions change?
:::

The new model should give slightly different estimates for the volume and clearance parameters, but the diagnostics should be quite similar.

If your model already includes WT as a covariate, perhaps centered on the median WT instead of 70 kilograms, replace it with the standard allometric exponents [@lst-v; @lst-cl].
Estimated exponents based on median WT can skew results when extrapolating beyond the observed range.

By converting to the standard WT of 70 kg and using standard exponent values, you leverage over 50 years of experience from other compounds when simulating outside adult data.
Additionally, if AGE or WT is included elsewhere in the model, remove these covariates.
They could cause problems with extrapolation after refitting the model with standard allometric exponents.

::: {.callout-caution}
Allometric scaling may not be valid at extreme body weights.
:::

#### Maturation

In neonates the maturation level of eliminating organs influences the estimates and in adults the body composition will affect them.
Data from pediatric development programs are often too limited to confirm whether allometric exponents differ from theoretical values.
MSWP considers the use of fixed exponents both scientifically justified and practical when developing popPK models in children.

::: {.callout-important}
Do not use allometric exponents estimated using adult data for pediatric PK models.
:::

In lower ages (**< 2 years**) there are also maturation functions (@eq-maturation) that come into play.
For these pediatric patients it is **important to include maturation function(s)** to describe pediatric PK.

Due to high correlation between body weight and age in pediatric patients, **maturation functions and allometric exponents should not be estimated simultaneously** ([Bonate (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1018828709196)).

### Step 2: Prepare a Data Set with Pediatric Simulation Subjects

Use either NHANES (US subjects 2--18 years), or a growth chart (e.g. WHO).
The WHO data is preferred for non-US studies or for pediatric patients less than 2 years of age.

::: {.callout-caution}
Because NHANES involves sampling individual subjects, there may be limited data in certain categories---especially for younger patients.
NHANES has limited data for younger age groups.
Therefore, for younger patients---usually those under 2 years of age, but sometimes under 6---it’s better to use the CDC or WHO growth charts instead.
:::

Create at least 250 simulation subjects in each age group of interest.
Age groups are described in @sec-age.
You can adjust these age groups based on the disease condition or target patient population.

The growth charts provide the distribution of WT for various ages and statures of children.
To create a simulation subject:

1. Generate a uniform distribution of ages in each age-group, with the desired number of subjects.
2. Create 250 simulated male subjects and 250 female subjects in the same age-group (e.g., 12--18 years).
3. For each of these 500 subjects, identify the mean and standard deviation for WT based on their specific AGE and SEX.
4. Randomly sample a single WT using the mean and standard deviation from the growth chart.

This process creates a set of simulation subjects with WT, age-group, and SEX.

Save this dataset for use in future PK simulations.

### Step 3: Simulate Exposures and Estimate Target Pediatric Doses

Randomly sample ETAs (in e.g. R) to calculate the individual PK-parameters for each simulation subject.
The WT will be used in the calculation of the V- and CL-parameters
Then, using the simulated individual PK-parameters, the appropriate dosing regimen is simulated using the adult clinical dose amount and the exposure metrics are calculated.

The exposure for each age group is calculated and compared to the reference exposure for adults.

Dose~ped,optimal~ = Dose~adult~ / (AUC~ped~ / AUC~adult~)

Adjust Dose~ped,optimal~ to a feasible amount (Dose~ped,adjusted~).
Rerun the simulations with the new dose and compare the simulated AUC~ped~ to the observed AUC~adult~.

It is expected that Dose~ped,optimal~ will be different for each age group.

Often plots that show the distribution of AUC~ped~ along with the distribution of AUC~adult~ or simulated values from individual adult subjects using the final popPK model using box-plots can be useful.

The plot with all age groups receiving the adult clinical dose can be contrasted with a plot with age groups using Dose~ped,adjusted~.

In addition, once you collect some data from pediatric patients, you can overlay the observed pediatric exposure measures with the simulated distributions to identify how well your model predicted the pediatric exposure.

## How to present results

The most relevant covariate to influence PK in pediatric patients is considered to be **body weight** accounting for size differences, in addition to **age** (@fig-age) in the youngest pediatric patients to account for maturation of drug eliminating processes (see @eq-maturation).

Relevant predefined exposure metrics should be presented graphically versus body weight and age on a continuous scale (@fig-cov).
If the drug is indicated to be used in the age range below one year, exposure vs body weight and age should be depicted in an additional separate figure focused on children 0--1 year of age.

The *blue line* is the median simulated pediatric C~ss~ and the *blue shaded area* encompasses 90% of the simulated paediatric patients. The *horizontal grey band* encompasses 90% of the simulated adult patients receiving 100 mg BID. [Schoemaker et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00228-017-2230-6).](images/pediatric-cov.png){#fig-cov}

If different doses are proposed for bands of weight or/and age, exposure ranges predicted for the proposed doses for the subsets of the pediatric population should be visualized as boxplots (@fig-box).
The reference range in the adult population (median and outer percentiles of observed or simulated data) should be given additionally (@fig-box).
The same statistics should be presented numerically in tables.

## Age groups {#sec-age}

![Pediatric age. PMA, post-menstrual age; D1, first day of last menstrual period; GA, gestational age; W, weeks; PNA, post-natal age](images/pediatric-age.png){#fig-age}

Approximate pediatric (chronologial) age groups:

* Neonates: birth--27 days (corrected gestational age, @eq-cga)
    * Preterm
    * Term
* Infants: 28 days--1 year
* Early childhood: 2--5 years
* Middle childhood: 6--11 years
* Adolescents 12--⁠17 years
    * PK often similar to adults
* Adults: >18 years
    * Acts as reference

:::{.callout-note}
A pediatric patient that is 17.9 years old belongs to the adolescent age group, until the 18^th^ birthday.

$$
\text{Corrected gestational age}_\text{weeks} = \text{PNA}_\text{weeks} - (40 - \text{GA}_\text{weeks})
$$ {#eq-cga}

Renal maturation, [Rhodin et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-008-0997-5):

$$
\text{maturation} = \text{PMA}^\text{Hill} / (\text{TM}_{50}^\text{Hill} + \text{PMA}^\text{Hill})
$$ {#eq-maturation}

The maturation half-life (TM~50~) is fixed to the literature value of 47.7 weeks and the Hill-exponent to the value of 3.4 (both from Rhodin et al.).
The distribution (mean, [min--max]) of PMA (weeks) in this study population was (518, [57--1652]).
Assuming renal maturation time differs in pre-term infants, a separate TM~50~ value could be estimated for them if the current model poorly describes this subgroup.
