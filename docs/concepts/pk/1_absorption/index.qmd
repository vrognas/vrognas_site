The normal range for transit time includes the following:

* Gastric emptying (2--5 hours)
  * Generally assumed as 2 hours.
  * Highly diverse and primarily depend on whether the body is fed or fasted, and the size and density of the dosage form.
* Small intestine transit (2--6 hours)
  * Relatively constant, not affected much.
* Colonic transit (10--59 hours)
  * Influenced by a number of factors such as diet, stress, dietary fiber content and disease.
  * Diarrhea increases colonic transit, constipation decreases it.
  * Human activity can also affect dosage form motility in the colon, with the inactive state of sleep delaying the colonic transit.
* Whole gut transit (10--72 hours).

Drug absorption can be characterized by **two** pharmacokinetic parameters:

- **Bioavailability ($\F$)** quantifies the **extent** of absorption.
- **$\ka$** quantifies the **rate** of absorption.

The oral bioavailability (F) of a drug is determined by three factors:

$$
\F =
  \mathrm{f_a} \cdot \mathrm{f_g} \cdot \mathrm{f_h} =
  \mathrm{f_a} \left(1 - \mathrm{E}_\text{GI}\right) \left(1 - \mathrm{E}_\text{H} \right)
$$ {#eq-bioavailability}

where

* f~a~ is the fraction of drug absorbed,  
* f~g~ is the fraction escaping gut-wall metabolism, and  
* f~h~ is the fraction escaping hepatic extraction.

See @eq-bioavailability and @fig-absorption for an illustration of these processes.

$$
\F =
  \left(
    \AUC_\text{po} / \AUC_\text{iv}
  \right)
  \left(
    \D_\text{iv} / \D_\text{po}
  \right)
$$

## Enterohepatic recirculation

@fig-enterohepatic-recirculation depicts enterohepatic recirculation, which can also influence bioavailability.
If a drug exhibits enterohepatic recirculation, it is common to see two or more absorption "peaks".
