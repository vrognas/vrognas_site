The cardiac conduction system (CCS, also called the electrical conduction system of the heart) transmits the signals generated by the sinoatrial node---the heart's pacemaker, to cause the heart muscle to contract, and pump blood through the body's circulatory system.

* **PQ-interval**: Time it takes before the signal has passed the atrioventricular (AV) node.
* **QRS-complex**: depolarization of the chambers.
* **ST-segment** and **T-wave**: repolarization of the chambers (return to "normal").

## Causes of QT-prolongation

* Drug inhibition of ion-channels in the heart
* Genetics (hereditary)
* Hypocalcemia, hypomagnesia

* Can in rare cases lead to fainting or death through **torsades de pointes (TdP)**, french for "twisting of peaks".

QT-prolongation ≠ risk for TdP

There are more factors needed for TdP, e.g. "early afterdepolarizations".

* QT-time is affected by heat rate: Corrected QTc-time (Bazetts and Fridericia's formulas)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{QTc}_\text{Bazett} = \frac{\mathrm{QT}}{\sqrt{HR}} \\
& \mathrm{QTc}_\text{Fridericia} = \frac{\mathrm{QT}}{\sqrt[3]{HR}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Thorough QT/QTc study

* According to ICH E14 (2005), *in general*, all drugs shall perform a thorough QT/QTc study early in development.
  * Large targeted proteins and monoclonal antibodies have a low likelihood of direct ion channel interactions and a thorough QT/QTc study is generally not necessary. (QA 2015)

* The threshold level of regulatory concern, is around **5 ms** as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms
* Drugs that prolong the mean QT/QTc interval by **>20 ms** have a substantially increased likelihood of being proarrhythmic

### How to perform the study

* The study is *typically* carried out in **healthy volunteers**
* Well controlled; **positive control group** recommended (assay sensitivity)
* **Crossover or parallel** group study designs
* Timing of the collection of ECGs and the study design (e.g., single or multiple dose, duration) should be guided by PK.
For drugs with short half-lives and no metabolites, a single dose study might be sufficient.
* Studies should characterize the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc throughout the dosing interval.
* Dose-response and generally the concentration-response for QT/QTc prolongation should be characterized
* **The drug should be tested at substantial multiples of the anticipated maximum therapeutic exposure**, unless there are other safety/tolerability concerns.
* The QT/QTc interval data should be presented both as analyses of central tendency (e.g., means, medians) and categorical analyses.
