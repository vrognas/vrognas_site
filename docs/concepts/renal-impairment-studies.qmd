| RI severity | GFR (mL/min) |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| Normal      | > 90         |
| Mild        | 60--90       |
| Moderate    | 30--60       |
| Severe (differs between FDA and EMA)| < 30, not requiring dialysis (EMA)|
| ESRD (differs between FDA and EMA)| < 15, requiring dialysis|

Studies:

Full or reduced.
Subjects "HV", apart from the RI.
Full: All RI groups
Reduced: Only Normal, severe, and ESRD.

6-8 subjects in each RI group.
This gives 80% power to detect plus/minus 40% change in exposure.

When:
Almost all small molecules.
Biologics <69 kDa

When not:
mAbs (>69 kDa)
