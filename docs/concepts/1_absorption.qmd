## Overview

Drug absorption can be characterized by **two** pharmacokinetic parameters:

- **Bioavailability (F)** quantifies the **extent** of absorption.
- **k<sub>a</sub>** quantifies the **rate** of absorption.

## Definition

The oral bioavailability (F) of a drug is determined by three factors:

$$
F = F_{a} \times F_{g} \times F_{h},
$$ {#eq-bioavailability}

where  
* F~a~ is the fraction of drug absorbed,  
* F~g~ is the fraction escaping gut-wall metabolism, and  
* F~h~ is the fraction escaping hepatic extraction.

See @eq-bioavailability and @fig-absorption for an illustration of these processes.

@fig-enterohepatic-recirculation depicts enterohepatic recirculation, which can also influence bioavailability.
If a drug exhibits enterohepatic recirculation, it is common to see two or more absorption "peaks".

## Modeling

Each component in the bioavailability equation can vary due to drug-specific physicochemical properties or physiological factors.
In turn, these variations can contribute to inter-individual variability (IIV) in **F**.

When **intravenous (IV) data** is unavailable for modeling oral pharmacokinetic (PK) data, a common practice is to attribute the IIV associated with **F** to the **apparent clearance (CL/F)** and **apparent volume of distribution (V/F)** parameters.
By doing so, any correlation between these two parameters can also be estimated.

Alternatively, one can directly introduce an IIV on **F** by fixing its value to 1 (renaming it *F~rel~*, "rel" for "relative") and estimating the inter-individual variability in **F~rel~** itself.
While this approach may not always improve predictive performance, it can be valuable if:

- **F-specific covariates** are suspected, or  
- **Residual unexplained variability (RUV)** must be accounted for in future simulations.
