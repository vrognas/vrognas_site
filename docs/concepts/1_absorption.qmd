## Overview

Drug absorption can be characterized by **two** pharmacokinetic parameters:

- **Bioavailability (F)** quantifies the **extent** of absorption.
- **k<sub>a</sub>** quantifies the **rate** of absorption.

## Definition

The oral bioavailability (F) of a drug is determined by three factors:

$$
F = F_{a} \times F_{g} \times F_{h},
$$ {#eq-bioavailability}

where  
* F~a~ is the fraction of drug absorbed,  
* F~g~ is the fraction escaping gut-wall metabolism, and  
* F~h~ is the fraction escaping hepatic extraction.

See @eq-bioavailability and @fig-absorption for an illustration of these processes.

@fig-enterohepatic-recirculation depicts enterohepatic recirculation, which can also influence bioavailability.
If a drug exhibits enterohepatic recirculation, it is common to see two or more absorption "peaks".
