title: "Concepts of the Craft"
---

Concepts of the Craft are a collection of documents that provide a high-level overview of a specific concept in the field of pharmacometrics.
They are intended to be a quick reference.
Each concept includes information on the definition, use cases, and implementation details for the concept.

## Impact

* What is the modeling used for? (e.g., bridging, dose, SmPC parameters?)
  * Does the aim align with the conclusion?
* What data is available?
  * Rich data
  * Sparse data
* What is the structural model?
  * Reasonable parameter estimates and RSE's?
  * Graphical evaluation (VPC first)
  * Covariate evaluation

* Exposure-response is generally non-informative if only one dose-level is given, even if weight-adjusted

## Reviewing models
* Does my conclusion align with the authors?
* Questions NGN (eNGiNe)
 * Need-to-know: Will affect conclusion (Major objection)
 * Good-to-know: Could affect conclusion (Other concern)
 * Nice-to-know: Won't affect conclusion (avoid asking this question)
