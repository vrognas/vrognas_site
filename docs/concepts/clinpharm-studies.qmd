## A short history of clinical trial "phases"

Prompted by the thalidomide tragedy, the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act introduced a "proof-of-efficacy" requirement.
This led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to introduce structured "phases" in clinical research, delineating the progression from initial human testing to comprehensive evaluations of therapeutic effectiveness. 

Previously, drug companies only had to show their new products were safe.
The way drugs were investigated, a physician from the company would go out in the community with some samples and say to the doctor, "I've got this new drug for so-and-so. Here are some samples. Try it out and let us know how you like it".
They would receive a letter from him stating, "I tried it out on eight patients, and they all got along fine."

  * Blinding
  * Adaptive, cross-over/parallel-group (Study type)
* **C**ontrol
  * What is the control group?
  * Placebo, standard-of-care, active comparator?
* **O**utcome
  * What is being measured (Covariates, PK, Clinical/pharmacological outcomes), when (Sampling/visit schedule, baseline and/or time-varying), and how?
* **T**ime

  * Run-in, active treatment, washout, follow-up periods

## Phases of drug development

The concept of "Phases" in clinical drug development originates from the FDA after WW2.
Most clinical pharmacology studies are Phase 1 studies, during which we **learn** about the drug's PK.
In Phase 2, we **learn** about the PD of the drug.
In Phase 3, we **confirm** our efficacy and safety hypotheses in the target population.

George Box views scientific progress as consisting of and requiring alternating steps of induction and deduction: the former is learning from experience, and the latter is confirmation of what has been learned.
A simplified application of this view to clinical drug development, which I define as first in humans to approval, would break development into two major learn-confirm cycles.

* First cycle (Proof-of-Concept)
  * Phase 1: **Learn** what is the tolerated dose? (Max tolerated dose?)
  * Phase 2a: **Confirm** that this dose has the promise of efficacy in a selected group of patients. (Is that dose efficacious?)
* Decision point: Is there a sufficiently positive indication of efficacy (and lack of toxicity) to justify further development? (Go/No go)
* Second cycle
  * Phase 2b: **Learn** how to use the drug in representative patients to make acceptable benefits/risks likely. (Effect on patients?)
  * Phase 3/4: **Confirm** in a large and representative patient population that acceptable benefit/risk is achieved. (Acceptable B/R-ratio?)
* Approval is Granted.

## Phase 1: Human pharmacology

Data from Phase 1 studies are typically well-controlled and provide clean SDTM input datasets.

* "First in human" (FIH) PK
  * Single ascending dose (SAD)
    * Subjects receive a **single dose** of the investigational drug at **one dose level**, with dose escalation in subsequent cohorts.
    * PK, safety, and/or PD can be of interest. 
  * Multiple ascending dose (MAD)
    * Like SAD, but each subject receives **multiple doses** at **one dose level**.
    * On some dosing occasions, only pre-dose samples might be taken.
    * Dose-adjustment rules can be in place to achieve desirable safety/efficacy.
* Food effect (for oral drugs)
* Pharmacogenomics (CYP genotyping)

## DM Points of interest in SAD/MAD Studies 

* In combined SAD-MAD studies subjects might be allowed to participate in both parts. In those cases, make sure to add a PERIOD/PART covariate and calculate TIME/TAD/TAFD for each study part. 
* Dosing information can come in different forms (EX or EC domain):
  * one record for each dose (e.g. 14 days, BID dosing results in 28 records per subject with dosing date/time)
  * records with from/until dosing date information; actual dosing time of the last one or two previous doses before a sample is recorded separately (or even in another domain like PC or SUPPEX)
  * Missed doses are sometimes not well documented; extra information can be included in SUPPEX domain. 

Renal/Hepatic Impairment Study: Participants enrolled in renal/hepatic impairment studies are typically separated into parallel cohorts with varying degrees of renal impairment (normal, mild, moderate, severe) as determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or other renal function markers (derived or included in data).
Similarly, participants with different stages of hepatic impairment (normal, mild, moderate, severe) may be separated based on assessments of liver function tests and clinical criteria.
For safety reasons the dose given in the moderately/severely impaired groups may be lower than for other groups. PK/PD and safety can be of interest. 

Food Effect Study: In a food effect study, participants typically receive two single doses, one fasted and one after a meal (fed) with a washout period between the two doses to ensure that the drug from the first dose is no longer present.
A subject in this case serves as its own control.
The order in which participants receive the drug under each condition may be randomized to reduce bias.
The study can also be set up in a cross-over design where both sequences of the conditions are observed for each subject (first sequence is fasted-fed and the second sequence is fed- fasted). 

## DM points of attention in Food Effect Study

* PERIOD, TREATMENT and SEQUENCE columns should be added to the dataset.
* Check if all drug from the first dose actually left the body (predose concentration of second dose should be BLQ).
* Calculate the time  after last dose (TAD) for predose samples of the second and subsequent periods relative to the correct dosing event (e.g for PopPK relative to the previous dose, for NCA relative to the next dose)

Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Study: A DDI study is used to evaluate the effect of administering the investigational drug alone versus in combination with another drug.
Several study designs are possible in a DDI study including parallel groups or crossover design with a washout period to ensure that the study drugs are completely eliminated and concentrations return to BLQ before the second treatment period.
The study can have either single dose or multi-dose administration. 

## DM points of attention in DDI 

* PERIOD, TREATMENT and SEQUENCE columns should be added
* Check if all drug from the first dose actually left the body (predose concentration of second dose should be BLQ)
* Calculate the time  after last dose (TAD) for predose samples of the second and subsequent periods relative to the correct dosing event (e.g for PopPK relative to the previous dose, for NCA relative to the next dose)

ADME (Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion) Study: ADME studies assess the disposition of a drug in the body.
These studies are often conducted as single-dose, open-label trials in a controlled clinical setting, analyzing the drug in biological matrices like plasma, urine, and feces.
To accurately track drug elimination, a small amount of a radioactive form of the drug is typically administered, enabling precise measurement of its excretion.
Often, these studies include the identification and characterization of drug metabolites.

## DM points of attention in ADME

* Volume of urine and weight of feces as well as the collection period should be collected and added to the dataset (for calculation of amount excreted)

## Phase 2: Therapeutic exploratory

Phase II/III studies are performed on patients and often consist of separate study parts/cohorts to investigate multiple scenarios in one study (e.g., different patient populations). In most cases, PD measurements will be part of the analysis (and should be included in the analysis dataset to enable PK-PD evaluations). The study design can be very diverse. 

* Mass Balance/ADME
* Drug-drug interaction (DDI) in vivo
* QT study
* Dose identification
* Healthy vs Patient PK & PD

## Phase 3: Therapeutic confirmatory

* Bioequivalence (BE), e.g., between formulations or drug combinations
* Exposure-efficacy/safety in the target population


## DM points of attention in Phase II/III studies

* Phase II/III studies are less controlled, resulting in unrecorded dosing times, missing laboratory measurements, etc.
* (Temporary) dose reductions/”holidays” can be implemented for individual patients due to safety issues.
* In most cases, only dosing times of occurring doses taken before a PK/PD sample are documented.

## Phase 4: Post-approval

* Relevant special populations
  * Renal impairment (RI)
  * Hepatic impairment (HI)
  * Pediatrics
  * Elderly
  * Pregnant
  * Lactating
  * Obese
  * Other
