## Good Clinical Practice (GCP)

GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials involving human subjects' participation.
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that trial subjects' rights, safety, and well-being are protected, consistent with the principles in the **Declaration of Helsinki**, and that the clinical trial data are credible.

ICH E6 provides a unified global standard for ethics, data quality, and subject safety.
Other ICH guidelines relevant to the conduct of clinical trials are:

* E2A (clinical safety data management)
* E3 (clinical study reporting)
* E7 (geriatric populations)
* E8 (general considerations for clinical trials)
* E9 (statistical principles)
* E11 (pediatric populations)

## Phases of drug development

### A short history of clinical trial "phases"

Prompted by the thalidomide tragedy, the 1962 *Kefauver-Harris Amendments* to the *U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act* introduced a "proof-of-efficacy" requirement.
This led the FDA to introduce structured "phases" in clinical research, describing the progression from First-in-Human trials to confirmatory pivotal trials.

Previously, drug companies only had to show their new products were safe.
The way drugs were investigated, a physician from the company would go out in the community with some samples and say to the doctor, "I've got this new drug for so-and-so. Here are some samples. Try it out and let us know how you like it".
They would then receive a letter from him stating, "I tried it out on eight patients, and they all got along fine."

### An overview of clinical trial "phases"

Most clinical pharmacology studies are Phase 1 studies, during which we **learn** about the drug's PK.
In Phase 2, we **learn** about the PD of the drug.
In Phase 3, we **confirm** our efficacy and safety hypotheses in the target population.

George Box views scientific progress as consisting of and requiring alternating steps of induction and deduction: the former is learning from experience, and the latter confirms what has been learned.
A simplified application of this view to clinical drug development would break development into two learn-confirm cycles @fig-cycles.

![A "Double Diamond" illustrating the two learn-confirm cycles of clinical drug development. After the first cycle, a point is reached where further development is decided upon. Finally, the drug is approved.](images/learn-confirm-cycles){#fig-cycles}

* First cycle (Proof-of-Concept)
  * Phase 1: **Learn** what is the tolerated dose? (Max tolerated dose?)
  * Phase 2a: **Confirm** that this dose has the promise of efficacy in a selected group of patients. (Is that dose efficacious?)
* Decision point: Is there a sufficiently positive indication of efficacy (and lack of toxicity) to justify further development? (Go/No go)
* Second cycle
  * Phase 2b: **Learn** how to use the drug in representative patients to make acceptable benefits/risks likely. (Effect on patients?)
  * Phase 3/4: **Confirm** in a large and representative patient population that acceptable benefit/risk is achieved. (Acceptable B/R-ratio?)
* Approval is granted.

### Studies within the phases

#### Phase 1: Human pharmacology

Data from Phase 1 studies are typically well-controlled and provide clean SDTM input datasets.

##### 👨‍⚕️"First in human" (FIH) PK

  * Single ascending dose (SAD)
    * Subjects receive a **single dose** of the investigational drug at **one dose level**, with dose escalation in subsequent cohorts.
    * PK, safety, and/or PD can be of interest. 
  * Multiple ascending dose (MAD)
    * Like SAD, but each subject receives **multiple doses** at **one dose level**.
    * On some dosing occasions, only pre-dose samples might be taken.
    * Dose-adjustment rules can be in place to achieve desirable safety/efficacy.

:::{.callout-note}
# Combined SAD-MAD studies

SAD and MAD studies can be combined under one study, and subjects can participate in both.
:::

##### 🍝Food effect (for oral drugs)

* Typically, a cross-over (fed/fasted), randomized, single-dose (one for each period) in healthy participants.
  * Similar to bioequivalence (BE) studies.

##### 💊+💊 Drug-drug interaction (DDI) *in vivo*

  * Evaluate the effect of co-administration with another drug.
  * Several study designs are possible in a DDI study, including parallel groups or cross-over designs.
  * The study can have either single-dose or multi-dose administration. 

##### ☢️ Mass Balance/ADME

  * Usually single-dose, open-label trials.
  * Small, radiolabeled dose to accurately track drug elimination in biological matrices (blood, plasma, urine, feces).
  * Often include metabolite identification and characterization.
  * Record the volume of urine, feces' weight, and collection duration for accurate excretion calculations.

##### 💊=💊 Bioequivalence (BE)

  * Typically, a cross-over randomized, single-dose (one for each period) in healthy participants.
  * Between formulations or drug combinations.
  * Evaluate the rate (Cmax and Tmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption

##### 💓 (T)QT study

  * Identifies medicines that prolong QT and thus need more thorough ECG monitoring in Phase 3 pivotal trials.

##### 🧬 Pharmacogenomics (CYP genotyping)

  * Often include metabolite identification and characterization.

##### 🚮 Organ dysfunction PK

  * Renal impairment (RI)
    * Subjects are typically separated into parallel cohorts with varying degrees of impairment (normal, mild, moderate, severe).
    * Impairment is often determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), preferably not using Cockcroft-Gault.
    * For safety reasons, the dose given to the moderately/severely impaired groups may be lower than that given to the other groups.
    * PK/PD and safety can be of interest. 
  * Hepatic impairment (HI)
    * Similar to RI studies.
    * Impairment is often determined by Child-Pugh scores or (in oncology) NCI-ODWG scores.

#### Phase 2: Therapeutic exploratory

Phase II/III studies are performed on patients and often consist of separate study parts/cohorts to investigate multiple scenarios (e.g., different patient populations) in one study.
In most cases, PD measurements will be part of the analysis (and should be included in the analysis dataset to enable PK-PD evaluations). The study design can be very diverse. 
Phase II/III studies are less controlled than Phase 1, resulting in unrecorded dosing times, missing laboratory measurements, etc.

##### 🤒 Healthy vs Patient PK/PD

* Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

##### 📈 Dose-response

  * Typically, randomized parallel group studies
  * Three or more dosage levels, one of which may be zero (placebo).
  * Including one or more doses of an existing medicine as a control may also be helpful.
  * As a rule, PoC is tested at the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) or the maximal administered dose if MTD was not defined.
  * Identify a reasonable starting (minimum effective) dose, ideally with specific adjustments.
  * Identify response-guided stepwise dose adjustment (titration) and the intervals at which they should be taken.
  * Identify a dose, or a response (desirable or undesirable), beyond which titration should not ordinarily be attempted because of lack of further benefit or an unacceptable increase in undesirable effect.
  * Identify optimal dose

##### 👩‍👦 Special populations

  * Pediatrics
  * Elderly
  * Pregnant
  * Lactating
  * Obese
  * Other

#### Phase 3: Therapeutic confirmatory

* PK and Exposure-Response (efficacy/safety) in the target population

#### Phase 4: Post-approval

Post-approval studies can, e.g., be studies in new indications.
