The concept of "Phases" in clinical drug development originates from the FDA, after WW2.
Most clinical pharamcology studies are Phase 1 studies, when we learn about the PK of the drug.
In Phase 2, we learn about the PD of the drug.

## Phase 1 First in Human

* First in human (FIH) PK/PD
  * Single ascending dose (SAD)
  * Multiple ascending dose (MAD)
* Food effect (for oral drugs)
* Pharmacogenomics (CYP genotyping)

## Phase 2

* Mass Balance/ADME
* Drug-drug interaction (DDI) in vivo
* QT study
* Dose identification
* Healthy vs Patient PK & PD
* Relevant special populations
  * RI
  * HI
  * Pediatrics
  * Elderly
  * Pregnant
  * Lactating
  * Obese
  * other

## Phase 3

* Bioequivalence (BE), eg between formulations or drug combinations
* Exposure-efficacy/safety in target population
