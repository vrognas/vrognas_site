**CDISC** stands for *Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium*.
CDISC provides several interrelated standards, each addressing a specific stage of the data lifecycle @fig-cdisc.
Each standard has an Implementation Guide (IG) that shows exactly how to apply that standard practically, e.g. SDTMIG for SDTM.
All the implementations have version numbers that are important to keep track of.

CDISC also provides TAUGs (Therapeutic Area User Guides).
A TAUG is a document providing guidance on applying CDISC standards to a specific therapeutic area (oncology, diabetes, CNS, etc.).

## CDASH

CDASH (Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization) standardizes how data are entered into *case report forms (CRFs)* at clinical sites.

## SDTM

SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model) organizes the data from CDASH into submission-ready datasets.
It includes different **domains/datasets** (e.g., exposure, and lab-values) and controlled terminology (e.g., how to name variables).

### General Observation Classes

General Observation Classes are high-level classifications within SDTM that group domains based on the type of data they contain.

There are three general observation classes: *Interventions*, *Events*, and *Findings*.
There is also a fourth observation class: *Special purpose*.

Observation classes are then grouped into **domains**, organized around a particular topic.
Each "domain" is usually a separate dataset; for example, EX can be a dataset containing exposure (dosing) data.
However, a domain can also be split into multiple datasets.
A typical example is splitting the Laboratory Test Results (LB) domain due to size.

| Observation Class         | Domain Name                                 | Domain Abbreviation |

: General observation classes in SDTM. {#tbl-goc}

### SDTM variables

Variables are classified as *required*, *expected*, or *permissible* for each domain.

#### Identifier

* STUDYID
* DOMAIN
* USUBJID
* --SEQ

#### Topic

Contain the focus of the observation.

* --TRT
* --TERM
* --TESTCD

#### Qualifier

Qualifiers provide additional information about the topic variables.

* Grouping
* Result
* Synonym
* Record
* Variable

#### Timing

Describes the timing of the observation.

* Date/times
* Study days
* Durations
* Intervals
* Visits
* Time points
* Relative times

## ADaM

ADaM (Analysis Data Model) takes SDTM data and transforms it into datasets suitable for statistical analysis.
It contains derived datasets used for tables, listings, figures.
Like SDTM it is organized into different **domains/datasets**, each with its specific setup.

https://www.cdisc.org/system/files/members/standard/foundational/ADaMIG_v1.3.pdf

### ADaM Standard data structures

* **ADSL:** Subject-level analysis dataset
  * One record per subject
* **BDS:** Basic data structure
  * One (or more) record per subject/parameter/timepoint
* **OCCDS:** Occurrence data structure
  * Designed for counting occurrences
* ADaM Other data structure

### ADaM variable conventions

####  General variable conventions

All ADaM variable names must be no more than 8 characters in length, start with a letter (not underscore), and be composed only of letters (A--Z), underscore ( _ ), and numerals (0--9).

ADaM adheres to a principle of harmonization known as "same name, same meaning, same values."

Generally, suppose an SDTM character variable is converted to a numeric variable in an ADaM dataset.
In that case, it should be named as it is in the SDTM dataset with an "**N**" suffix added.

In a pair of corresponding variables (e.g., TRTP and TRTPN), the primary or most commonly used variable does not have the suffix or extension (i.e., **N** for numeric or **C** for character).
The relevant suffix is used only on the name of the secondary member of the variable pair.

Variables whose names end in **FL** are character flag (or indicator) variables.

Variables whose names end in **GR*y***, **G*y***, or **CAT*y*** are grouping variables, where "*y*" refers to the grouping scheme or algorithm (not the category within the grouping).

It is recommended that producer-defined grouping or categorization variables begin with the name of the variable being grouped and end in **GR*y*** (e.g., variable ABCGR*y* is a character description of a grouping or categorization of the values from the ABC variable for analysis purposes).

#### Timing variable conventions

Variables whose names end in **DT** are numeric dates.

Variables whose names end in **DTM** are numeric datetimes.

Variables whose names end in **TM** are numeric times.

Names of timing **start variables** end with an **S** followed by the characters indicating the type of timing (i.e., SDT, STM, SDTM).

Names of timing **end variables** end with an **E** followed by the characters indicating the type of timing (i.e., EDT, ETM, EDTM)

Variables whose names end in **DY** are relative day variables.

#### Variable naming fragments

| G*y* | Abbreviation of GR*y* |
| FL | Flag/indicator |

| DTF | Date imputation flag |
| TMF | Time imputation flag |
| DY | Relative days (does not include day 0) |

## SEND

SEND (Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data) mirrors SDTM but for non-clinical (animal) studies, describing how data is organized.
