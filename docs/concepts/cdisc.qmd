# Under construction
:::

**CDISC** stands for *Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium*.
CDISC provides several interrelated standards, each addressing a specific stage of the data lifecycle @fig-cdisc.
Each standard has an Implementation Guide (IG) that shows exactly how to apply that standard practically, e.g. SDTMIG for SDTM.
All the implementations have version numbers that are important to keep track of.

## SEND (Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data)

SEND mirrors SDTM but for non-clinical (animal) studies, describing how data is organized.

## CDASH (Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization)

CDASH standardizes how data are entered into *case report forms (CRFs)* at clinical sites.

## SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model)

SDTM organizes the data from CDASH into submission-ready datasets.
It includes different **domains/datasets** (e.g., exposure, and lab-values) and controlled terminology (e.g., how to name variables).

## ADaM (Analysis Data Model)

ADaM standardizes how to organize data so that is as close as possible to be ready for statistical analysis.
It contains derived datasets used for tables, listings, figures.
Like SDTM it is organized into different **domains/datasets**, each with its specific setup.





## SEND

**SEND:** The Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data Implementation Guide (SENDIG) is based on the SDTM and guides users on the organization, structure, and format of standard nonclinical study tabulation datasets for exchange between organizations or to be submitted to a regulatory authority.
The following videos introduce you to the SENDIG and the SDTM, which, together, serve as a map that orients you to how your data fits into the standard.

## Study data tabulation model (SDTM)

All the implementations, as well as SDTM itself, have version numbers.
The implementations are always based on one SDTM version.

### General Observation Classes

There are three general observation classes: *Interventions*, *Events*, and *Findings*.
There is also a fourth observation class: *Special purpose*.
Further, observation classes are grouped into **domains**, organized around a particular topic. 
Each "domain" is essentially a separate dataset; for example, EX can be a dataset containing exposure (dosing) data.
The distinction between domain and dataset is most clearly seen in cases where a general observation class domain is split into multiple datasets in a submission.
Typical examples are splitting the Laboratory Test Results (LB) domain due to size, splitting the Questionnaires (QS) domain by questionnaire, and splitting the Findings About Events or Interventions (FA) domain by parent domain.
Variables are classified as *required*, *expected*, or *permissible* for each domain.

#### Interventions

* Procedure agents (AG)
* Concomitant/prior medications (CM)
* Exposure (EX)
* Exposure as collected (EC)
* Meal data (ML)
* Procedures (PR)
* Substance use (SU)

#### Events

* Adverse events (AE)
* Biospecimen events (BE)
* Clinical events (CE)
* Disposition (DS)
* Healthcare encounters (HO)
* Medical history (MH)
* Protocol deviations (DV)

#### Findings

* Product/drug accountability (DA)
* Death details (DD)
* ECG test results (EG)
* Inclusion/Exclusion criteria not met (IE)
* Biospecimen findings (BS)
* Cell phenotype findings (CP)
* Genomics findings (GF)
* Immunogenicity specimen assessments (IS)
* Laboratory test results (**LB**)
* Microbiology specimen (MB)
* Microbiology susceptibility (MS)
* Microscopic findings (MI)
* PK concentrations (**PC**)
* PK parameters (**PP**)
* Morphology (MO)
* Cardiovascular system findings (CV)
* Musculoskeletal system findings (MK)
* Nervous system findings (NV)
* Ophthalmic examinations (OE)
* Reproductive system findings (RP)
* Respiratory system findings (RE)
* Urinary system findings (UR)
* Physical examination (PE)
* Functional tests (FT)
* Questionnaires (QS)
* Disease response and clinical classification (RS)
* Subject characteristics (SC)
* Subject status (SS)
* Tumor/lesion identification (TU)
* Tumor/lesion results (TR)
* Vital signs (**VS**)
* Findings about events or interventions (FA)
* Skin response (SR)

#### Special purpose

### SDTM variables

#### Identifier

* STUDYID
* DOMAIN
* USUBJID
* --SEQ

#### Topic

Contain the focus of the observation.

* --TRT
* --TERM
* --TESTCD

#### Qualifier

Qualifiers provide additional information about the topic variables.

* Grouping
* Result
* Synonym
* Record
* Variable

#### Timing

Describes the timing of the observation.

* Date/times
* Study days
* Durations
* Intervals
* Visits
* Time points
* Relative times

## ADaM: Analysis Data Model

https://www.cdisc.org/system/files/members/standard/foundational/ADaMIG_v1.3.pdf

### ADaM Standard data structures

* **ADSL:** Subject-level analysis dataset
  * One record per subject
* **BDS:** Basic data structure
  * One (or more) record per subject/parameter/timepoint
* **OCCDS:** Occurrence data structure
  * Designed for counting occurrences
* ADaM Other data structure

### ADaM variable conventions

####  General variable conventions

All ADaM variable names must be no more than 8 characters in length, start with a letter (not underscore), and be composed only of letters (A--Z), underscore ( _ ), and numerals (0--9).

ADaM adheres to a principle of harmonization known as "same name, same meaning, same values."

Generally, suppose an SDTM character variable is converted to a numeric variable in an ADaM dataset.
In that case, it should be named as it is in the SDTM dataset with an "**N**" suffix added.

In a pair of corresponding variables (e.g., TRTP and TRTPN), the primary or most commonly used variable does not have the suffix or extension (i.e., **N** for numeric or **C** for character).
The relevant suffix is used only on the name of the secondary member of the variable pair.

Variables whose names end in **FL** are character flag (or indicator) variables.

Variables whose names end in **GR*y***, **G*y***, or **CAT*y*** are grouping variables, where "*y*" refers to the grouping scheme or algorithm (not the category within the grouping).

It is recommended that producer-defined grouping or categorization variables begin with the name of the variable being grouped and end in **GR*y*** (e.g., variable ABCGR*y* is a character description of a grouping or categorization of the values from the ABC variable for analysis purposes).

 #### Timing variable conventions

Variables whose names end in **DT** are numeric dates.

Variables whose names end in **DTM** are numeric datetimes.

Variables whose names end in **TM** are numeric times.

Names of timing **start variables** end with an **S** followed by the characters indicating the type of timing (i.e., SDT, STM, SDTM).

Names of timing **end variables** end with an **E** followed by the characters indicating the type of timing (i.e., EDT, ETM, EDTM)

Variables whose names end in **DY** are relative day variables.
