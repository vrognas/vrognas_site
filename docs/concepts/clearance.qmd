title: "Clearance (CL)"

Clearance (CL) is a **made-up** pharmacokinetic parameter.
The fact that it is made-up and has no physical meaning is an important concept to understand.
What's more, this parameter is near impossible to interpret on its own, but somehow is still common to see in the summary of product characteristics for approved drugs.

A more intuitive parameter is the half-life (t~1/2~), which is the time it takes for the concentration of a drug to decrease by half.
However, even the half-life has issues in the current state of drug development.
The half-life of a drug is really only useful if a drug follws one-compartment pharmacokinetics.
It is rare for modern drugs to follow one-compartment pharmacokinetics.
