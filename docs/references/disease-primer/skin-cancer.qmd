There are three main types of skin cancer:
* Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC)
  * Most common
  * Rarely metastasizes
  * Low mortality
* Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC)
  * Can spread quickly and metastasize
  * Low mortality
  * Can be cured if caught early
* Melanoma
  * Least frequent
  * Can spread
  * Highest mortality
  * Can be cured if caught early

BCC and SCC are also known as *Non-melanoma skin cancer* (NMSC).

### BCC

Grows slowly, damages nearby tissues.

### SCC

It is a cancer of *squamous cells*.
These cells form on the surface of the skin, on the lining of hollow organs in the body, and on the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts.
Also known as **epidermoid carcinoma**.

The cancer can be divided into types depending on the body location:

* Head and neck SCC (HNSCC)
* Cutaneous SCC (cSCC)
  * aka *squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin* or *squamous-cell skin cancer*
* Squamous-cell carcinoma of the thyroid (SCT)
  * aka *thyroid squamous-cell carcinoma*

### Melanoma

## Typical patient

### Risk factors

* Sun exposure
* A history of sunburns
