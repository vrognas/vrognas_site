title: "Disease primer: Bacterial infections"
---

A bacterial infection is classified according to the site of infection, and sometimes also the source of infection.

* Skin
* Lung (HAP/VAP or nosocomial pneumonia)
  * Pseudomonas not in gut, it is found in shower heads or sinks -> can only infect after ABX trt, when gut flora is compromised.
* IAI
* BSI

## Sepsis

Sepsis is a special life-threatening state.
Occurs rarely in UTI, mostly in lung infections.

The SOFA-score is often used to assess organ failure in septic patients.

### Septic chock

Septic chock is a development of sepsis that is even more severe.

## Treatment

* Most infections can be treated in 5â€“7 days
* 95% empirical treatment first ("hit hard and hit early" -Paul Erlich)
* Treatment re-evaluation after 3 days
    * 48 h needed to see if ABX works

### What we want to know before treating an infection

1. Probable infection source
    1. History
    2. Examination (lab tests, x-ray, CT-scan)
2. Probable bacteria & antibiotic susceptibility
    1. Medical training
    2. Local epidemiology
3. Individual resistance risk
    1. Previous infection with resistant bacteria
    2. Recent travel
    3. Hospitalization or antibiotics
4. Other considerations
    1. Allergy
    2. Other drugs (interaction risk)
    3. Co-morbidities
    4. PK

Resistance rates: how many are resistant? In percent.

* Biomarkers not specific
    * 3 markers + WBC (but unspecific)
        * CRP (comes late)
        * PCT (quicker than CRP)
        * IL-6
* Microbroth
    * Accurate + expensive
* Vitek (turbidity), (will be replaced by MALDI-TOF?)
    * Not as accurate as microbroth
* Clinical dogmas: Foreign body infection -> biofilm
* Immunosuppressive
