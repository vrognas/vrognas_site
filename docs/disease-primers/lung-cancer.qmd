There are three main types of skin cancer, depending on which cells have turned cancerous:

* Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) ~15% of cases
* Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ~85% of cases
  * Adenocarcinomas ~40% of cases
  * Squamous-cell carcinomas ~30% of cases
  * Large-cell carcinomas ~15% of cases
* Other rare types

## Diagnosis

Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope.
