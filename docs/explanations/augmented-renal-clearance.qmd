title: "Augmented Renal Clearance (ARC)"
---

Augmented renal clearance (ARC) is a term used when a patients' creatinine clearance (CrCL) exceeds 130 mL/min/1.73m^2^.

Standard CrCL estimation equations are inaccurate at these high CrCL values.

Critically ill patients often have rapidly fluctuating renal function.

ARC is most common in critically ill young men.

## ARC in critically ill: an enigmatic concept

ARC is defined as estimated GFR > 130 ml/min. In a
study by Andrew Udy et al. [16], 17 of 20 patients (85%)
with traumatic brain injury who required saline infusion
and vasopressor agents to maintain the cerebral perfusion pressure had ARC. Using timed urinary creatinine
clearance method to measure GFR, ARC was demonstrated in burns [17,18], sepsis [19] and surgery, and in
ICU patients. Brown et al. [20] recorded a creatinine
clearance of 190 ml/min/1.73 m2 in a cohort of critically
ill postoperative patients. Recently, Fuster-Lluch et al. [21]
reported an incidence of 17.9% in a cohort of postoperative and polytrauma patients, who were younger, with
lower Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) II scores, higher diastolic blood pressures, and
higher urine output on the first morning of admission to
the ICU. Cytokine release from acute injury [22], the innate immune and inflammatory responses to trauma [23],
and aggressive fluid resuscitation may promote increased
organ blood flow and enhanced excretory function. The
importance of the concept is quite obvious. This throws
light on the doses of renally excreted drugs and may mean
that standard dosing regimens are inadequate in patients
with ARC. Baptista et al. [24] examined the performance of four creatinine-based estimation equations in 86
patients with ARC. This post hoc analysis showed that
all the better known GFR equations underestimated the
measured creatinine clearance value. The list below
illustrates the practical problems in estimating GFR in
an ICU setup:

1. Rapidly fluctuating renal hemodynamics
2. Both overdosing and underdosing are problems
when GFR could not be estimated close to accuracy
3. Constantly changing volume status of the patient
4. Concept of ARC is not frequently applied in
calculating GFR leading to inadequate dosing of
drugs
5. Commonly used creatinine-based equations are
flawed in the critical care setting. Ideal methods like
inulin clearance become impractical in an ICU setup
