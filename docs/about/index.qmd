## 🏅 Awards and Scholarships

* **The Pharmaceutical Student Union’s Study Council Award for Student Treatment**, *Pharmaceutical Student Union* (2021)

> During the spring semester of 2020, courses were taught remotely when COVID-19 began to spread in Sweden. Students experienced difficulties with remote work. Viktor approached and understood the students, brought forward their opinions to the ones responsible and stayed after hours to help the students that needed extra help with their individual projects. Thanks to Viktor’s admirable approach, the upcoming courses could be optimized for students.

* **Börjessons äldre**, *Uppsala University* (2018)

> "...for male students who are studying towards licentiate or higher degrees, [and] are distinguished by dedication and aptitude..."

* **Linds, Hans**, *Uppsala University* (2017)

> "... well-mannered male student who has been registered at the Faculty of Medicine at Uppsala University for at least one academic year is awarded by the faculty..."

* **Gahn Foundation for Students of Chemistry**, *Uppsala University* (2014)
