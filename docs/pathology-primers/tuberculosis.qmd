## What is TB?

![](images/tb-1.png){#fig-tb-1}

Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial disease which usually affects the lungs, but cn also affect other organs.
Transmitted via airborne droplets.
In many cases it is symptomless (latent/dormant TB) (around 25% of global population has this), but can progress to active disease which kills around half of those affected if left untreated.

### Different bacterial states

dormant=non-multiplying
multiplying

### Drug resistant TB

Myobacterium tuberculosis divides more slowly than most bacteria, making development of antibiotic resistance more likely (@fig-tb-amr-1).
In addition, the mycolic acids in its cell wall limit the effectiveness of some antibiotics.

## How can it be treated?

* Delamanid

Active TB is treated with several antibiotics for a minimum of 6 months.
The four drugs shown in @fig-tb-trt-1 are commonly used first line drugs in treatment regimes.
Streptomycin was formerly considered a first line drug, but is now used less due to increased cases of resistance to its effects.

### Drug-sensitive TB (6 months of treatment)

* 2 months: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol (HRZE)
* 4 months: isoniazid, rifampicin (HR)

### MDR-TB (6--18 months of treatment)

Tuberculosis that is resistant to first line drugs (@fig-tb-trt-1) must be treated with second line drugs (@fig-tb-trt-2).
These can include drugs that are usually less effective, which have toxic side effects, or which are unavailable in developing countries.

* 6 months: bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, moxifloxacin (BPaLM)
