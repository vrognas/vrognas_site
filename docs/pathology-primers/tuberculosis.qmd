## What is TB?

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by **bacteria** (*Mycobacterium tuberculosis*) that usually affects the **lungs**, but can also affect other organs.
TB spreads through airborne droplets when people with TB cough, sneeze or spit.
About 25% of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria.
Those who are infected but free of disease cannot spread it.
About 7.5% of people infected with TB will eventually get symptoms and develop TB disease.
If left untreated, active TB disease kills around 50% of those affected.

*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* has been suggested to exist in three states, showcased in @fig-mtb-model (Clewe et al. 2016).

### Drug resistant TB

*Myobacterium tuberculosis* divides more slowly (~q18h) than most bacteria, making development of antibiotic resistance more likely.
In addition, the mycolic acids in its cell wall limit the effectiveness of some antibiotics.

**MDR-TB** has been defined as <span class="red-underline">**resistance to rifampicin plus isoniazid**</span>.

Extensively drug-resistant TB (**XDR-TB**) describes resistance to at least one fluoroquinolone as well as bedaquiline and/or linezolid and/or a second-line injectable in addition to rifampicin and isoniazid.

## What are the symptoms?

* Coughing 😮‍💨
* Weight loss 📉
* Chest pains 😧
* Fatigue 😩
* Fever 🤒
* Loss of apetite 🍽️

### Typical patient population

### Risk factors

## Diagnosis

A sputum sample is collected and tested using the **Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay** (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA).
This diagnoses TB and the detects rifampicin resistance.

## How can TB be treated?

Tuberculosis is preventable and curable.
Active pulmonary TB is treated with <span class="red-underline">**several antibiotics for a minimum of 6 months**</span>.

### Drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) (6 months of treatment)

1. **2 months**: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol (HRZE)
2. **4 months**: isoniazid, rifampicin (HR)

Such a regimen is also spelled as **2HRZE/4HR**, meaning 2 months of HRZE treatment followed by 4 months of HR treatment.

:::{.callout-note}
# 12% of cases are resistant to at least rifampicin
:::

For **children** (3 mo -- 16 y), **2HRZ(E)/2HR** should be used.

### Multi-drug/rifampicin resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) (6--18 months of treatment)

* **6 months**: bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, moxifloxacin (BPaLM)

The second-line treatment contains bedaquiline, levofloxacin/moxifloxacin, ethionamide, ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and clofazimine (all-oral regimen) administered for up to 9 months.

### Drug characteristics

#### Bedaquiline

  *  f~b~ ≈ 99%
  * Food effect
  * CYP3A4 metabolism
  * Most common adverse events: QTc-prolongation, and hepatotoxicity

#### Linezolid

  * Highly variable PK
  * Inhibits its own CL
  * F ≈ 100%
  * No food effect
  * "non-enzymatic metabolism"
  * Known toxicity at higher doses and/or longer durations

#### Rifampicin

Old drug.

  * Strong enzyme inducer of enzymes and pumps, it thus induces its own CL
  * Also saturable biliary excretion -> higher than dose-prop exposures -> F is dose dependent.
