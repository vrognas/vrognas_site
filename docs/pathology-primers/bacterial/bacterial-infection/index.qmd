## What are bacterial infections?

For an infectious agent, **infectivity** refers to the proportion of exposed persons who become infected.
**Pathogenicity** refers to the proportion of infected individuals who develop clinically apparent disease.
**Virulence** refers to the proportion of clinically apparent severe or fatal cases.
The disease process may never progress to clinically apparent illness or result in illness that ranges from mild to severe or fatal. This range is called the **spectrum of disease**.
Ultimately, the disease process ends in recovery, disability, or death (see @fig-periods).

A bacterial infection is classified according to the site of infection and sometimes also the source of infection (see @fig-overview). Some examples include:

* Skin infections
  * Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI)
* Lung infections
  * Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
    * Probably *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*)
  * Hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP)
    * Probably *S. aureus*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Enterobacteria*
    * *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is not in the gut but on shower heads or sinks. It can only infect after antibiotic treatment when the gut flora is compromised.
* Intra-abdominal infection (IAI)
* Blood-stream infection (BSI)
* Urinary-tract infection (UTI)

### Sepsis

Sepsis is a special life-threatening state.
Occurs rarely during UTI, mostly in lung infections.

The SOFA score is often used to assess organ failure in septic patients.

#### Septic shock

Septic shock is a development of sepsis that is even more severe.

## Symptoms

### Periods of disease

The progression of an infectious disease can be divided into five periods, which are related to the number of pathogen particles and the severity of signs and symptoms (@fig-periods).
Infectious diseases can be contagious during all five of the periods of disease.

|   #   | Period/Phase/Stage | Description |
| :---: | :----------------- | :---------- |
|   1   | Incubation/latency | Pathogen replicates. No signs or symptoms. |
|   2   | Prodromal (subclinical disease) | Pathogeon replicates. General signs and symptoms. The immune system is active. |
|   3   | Illness (clinical disease) | Most severe and characteristic signs and symptoms. **Usual time of diagnosis is early in this period.** |
|   4   | Decline            | Pathogen particle-count declines. Signs and symptoms improve. Immune system possibly weakened---susceptibility to secondary infection. |
|   5   | Convalescence      | Patient returns to normal function. Signs and symptoms resolve. Some permanent damage might have occurred. |

Stages might overlap.
The onset of symptoms marks the transition from subclinical to clinical disease.

![Periods of disease. This particular figure shows a complete recovery after illness. One can also imagine cases where the severity of symptoms never completely goes back to baseline (a disability) or a case where the curves are truncated earlier in time (a death). Indeed, the time-scale is arbitrary here, as is the distance in time between the different periods. The periods of disease could even overlap in some diseases, adding to the complexity.](../../images/bac-inf_periods.avif){#fig-periods}

## Diagnosis

![Typical plasma concentration-time profiles of different biomarkers of bacterial infections. Adapted from Meisner M., (1999) @meisnerProcalcitoninErfahrungenMit1999](../../images/bac-inf_biomarkers.avif){#fig-biomarkers}

* Biomarkers not specific
    * 3 markers + WBC (but unspecific)
        * CRP (comes late)
        * PCT (quicker than CRP)
        * IL-6
* Microbroth
    * Accurate + expensive
* Vitek (turbidity), (will be replaced by MALDI-TOF?)
    * Not as accurate as microbroth

## How can it be treated?

> "Hit hard and hit early" -Paul Erlich

In almost all cases, an empirical treatment is used first.
There is no time to wait for culture results.
The "right" treatment is 90% successful, and the "wrong" treatment is 60% successful (known as the **"90/60 rule"**).

Most infections can be treated in 5--7 days.

### What we want to know before treating an infection

1. Probable infection source
    * History
    * Examination (lab tests, X-ray, CT-scan)
2. Probable bacteria & antibiotic susceptibility (see e.g. @fig-overview)
    * Medical training
    * Local epidemiology
    * Resistance rates: How many percent are resistant?
      * ESKAPE
3. Individual resistance risk
    * Previous infection with resistant bacteria
    * Recent travel
    * Hospitalization or antibiotics
4. Other considerations
    * Allergy
    * Other drugs (interaction risk)
    * Co-morbidities
    * PK

* Clinical dogmas: Foreign body infection -> biofilm
* Immunosuppressive

### After initial treatment

* Treatment re-evaluation after 3 days
    * 48 hours needed to evaluate antibiotic efficacy
    * The efficacy of antibiotic treatment is judged by **signs and symptoms** (Are you feeling better than yesterday?), and the course of **inflammatory markers** (WBC, CRP, PCT)
* Empiric treatment should ideally be switched to targeted therapy once culture results are available (2--3 days)
