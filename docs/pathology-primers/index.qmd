Pathology Primers are a collection of documents that provide a high-level overview of a specific disease.
They are intended to be a quick reference for medical students, residents, and other healthcare professionals. Each primer includes information on the typical patient, risk factors, clinical diagnostics, and treatment options for the disease.

They typically follow this structure:

1. What is X?
  * Commonly used PD-models
2. What are the symptoms?
  * Typical patient population
  * Risk factors
3. Diagnosis
4. How can it be treated?
  * Treatment aim (PD-targets)
  * Drug regimens
  * Commonly used PK-models
