## Disease facts that are good to know

Each primer provides a concise, high-level summary of a disease relevant to pharmacometricians, focusing on biomarkers, drug regimens, and modeling approaches.

Typical structure for disease "XYZ":

1. What is XYZ?
  * Disease definition & pathophysiology
  * Commonly used Pharmacodynamic (PD) Models (e.g., disease progression models, target engagement)
2. Patient characteristics
  * Typical patient population
  * Risk factors & disease progression indicators
3. Diagnosis & biomarkers
  * Key Clinical Biomarkers (e.g., lab values, thresholds, imaging)
  * Disease Severity Classification (if applicable, e.g., staging systems)
4. How can XYZ be treated?
  * Treatment aim (PD-targets)
  * Common Drug Classes & Regimens
    * Mechanism of Action (MoA)
    * First-line vs. second-line treatments
    * Dose Adjustments (e.g., renal/liver impairment, pediatrics)
  * Commonly used PK-models
