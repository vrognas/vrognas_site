## What is Psoriasis?

### Disease definition & pathophysiology

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder.
It involves rapid proliferation of keratinocytes, dysfunctional epidermal differentiation, and infiltration by immune cells (T-helper cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils).
Key inflammatory mediators driving psoriasis include cytokines like TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-23.

### Commonly used Pharmacodynamic (PD) Models
- Disease progression models (e.g., turnover models for plaque development and resolution)
- Indirect response models (cytokine-driven inflammatory response)
- Target engagement models (cytokine suppression, receptor occupancy models for biologics)

## Patient characteristics

### Typical patient population

- Commonly presents in adults aged 15–35 and 50–60 years
- Equal prevalence among genders
- Worldwide prevalence approximately 2–3%

### Risk factors & disease progression indicators

- Family history and genetic predisposition (e.g., HLA-Cw6 allele)
- Environmental triggers: infections, stress, medications, trauma
- Comorbidities: psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome
- Disease progression indicated by extent/severity of skin involvement and responsiveness to initial therapies

## Diagnosis & biomarkers

### Key Clinical Biomarkers

- Clinical evaluation of skin lesions (plaque thickness, erythema, scaling)
- Imaging rarely used, except to evaluate psoriatic arthritis (MRI, X-ray)
- Non-specific inflammation markers (CRP, ESR) sometimes elevated

### Disease Severity Classification

- **Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI):**
  - Mild: PASI < 10  
  - Moderate-to-severe: PASI ≥ 10
- **Body Surface Area (BSA) involvement:**
  - Mild: <3%, Moderate: 3–10%, Severe: >10%
- Physician Global Assessment (PGA) commonly used

## How can Psoriasis be treated?

### Treatment aim (PD-targets)

- Suppression of inflammation, reduction of epidermal hyperproliferation, and normalization of immune dysregulation
- Primary targets: TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23, IL-12 pathways

### Common Drug Classes & Regimens

#### Topical Agents *(first-line for mild psoriasis)*

- Corticosteroids, Vitamin D analogs (calcipotriol), Retinoids (tazarotene)  
**MoA:** Anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative actions on keratinocytes

#### Phototherapy *(moderate disease or resistant cases)*

- UVB therapy, PUVA (psoralen + UVA)  
**MoA:** Induces apoptosis of activated immune cells, reduces keratinocyte proliferation

#### Systemic treatments (oral) *(moderate-to-severe psoriasis)*

- Methotrexate, Cyclosporine, Acitretin  
**MoA:** Immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative effects

#### Biologic therapies *(moderate-to-severe psoriasis, second-line after systemic therapies)*

- **TNF-α inhibitors:** Adalimumab, Etanercept, Infliximab
- **IL-17 inhibitors:** Secukinumab, Ixekizumab, Brodalumab
- **IL-23 inhibitors:** Guselkumab, Risankizumab, Tildrakizumab
- **IL-12/23 inhibitor:** Ustekinumab  
**MoA:** Targeted suppression of specific inflammatory cytokines

#### Dose Adjustments

- Biologics usually dosed by body weight, minimal adjustments required for renal/hepatic impairment
- Methotrexate and Cyclosporine require renal and hepatic dose adjustments
- Pediatric dosing based on weight and disease severity

### Commonly used PK-models

- One- or two-compartment pharmacokinetic models (particularly for biologics)
- Population PK-models incorporating covariates (body weight, immunogenicity, PASI scores)
- Exposure-response models linking drug concentration/exposure to PASI improvement
