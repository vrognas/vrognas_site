## What is RA?

An auto-immune systemic disease.
Requires life-long treatment.
Individual patients with RA appear to have different pathogenic mechanisms, due to different treatment response.
Two major "types": seropositive and seronegative, with seropositive presenting more severe symptoms.

### Risk factors

* First-degree relative with RA
* Gene HLA-DR
* Smoking
* Overweight
* Infections

## What are the symptoms?

### Typical patient

* Age 30-70
* 70% women
* Symmetrical polyarthritis of hands and feet.
* Common to have *morning stiffness* lasting more than 30 minutes.

## Diagnosis

* Number and location of affected joints
* Duration of disease >= 6 weeks
* Acute-phase reactants
* X-ray for bone erosion
* Serum samples to determine seropositive/seronegative
  * Rheumatiod factor (RF)
  * Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs)

## How can it be treated?

* DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs)
  * Conventional
    * Methotrexate (folate antagonist)
      * Typical treatment, 33% response rate.
    * Leflunomide
    * Sulfasalazine
    * Hydroxychloroquine
  * Biologic (either alone or combo with conventionals)
    * Anti TNF-alpha
      * Adalimumab
      * Certolizumab
      * Etanercept
      * Golimumab
      * Infliximab
    * Anti IL6
      * Tocilizumab
      * Sarilumab
    * B-cell depletion
      * Rituximab
    * T-Cell co-stimulatory inhibitor
      * Abatacept
  * Targeted synthetic
    * JAK inhibitor
      * Tofacitinib
      * Baricitinib
      * Upadacitinib
