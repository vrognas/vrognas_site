## Important considerations

### Impact of a model

* What is the modeling used for? (e.g., bridging, dose, SmPC^[Summary of Product Characteristics] parameters?)
  * Does the conclusion align with the aim?
* What data is available?
  * Rich data
  * Sparse data
* What is the structural model?
  * Reasonable parameter estimates and RSE^[Relative standard error]'s?
  * Graphical evaluation (VPC^[Visual Predictive Check] first)
  * Covariate evaluation

* Exposure-response is generally non-informative if only one dose-level is given, even if weight-adjusted

### Reviewing models
* Does my conclusion align with the authors?
* Questions NGN (eNGiNe)
  * Need-to-know: Will affect conclusion (Major objection)
  * Good-to-know: Could affect conclusion (Other concern)
  * Nice-to-know: Won't affect conclusion (avoid asking this question)
