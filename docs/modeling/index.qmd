## Important considerations

### Impact of a model [@musuambaScientificRegulatoryEvaluation2021; @skottheimrustenScientificRegulatoryEvaluation2021]

* What is the modeling used for? (e.g., bridging, dose, SmPC^[Summary of Product Characteristics] parameters?)
  * Does the conclusion align with the aim?
* What data is available?
  * Rich data
  * Sparse data
* What is the structural model?
  * Reasonable parameter estimates and RSE^[Relative standard error]'s?
  * Graphical evaluation (VPC^[Visual Predictive Check] first)
  * Covariate evaluation

* Exposure-response is generally non-informative if only one dose-level is given, even if weight-adjusted

### Reviewing models
* Does my conclusion align with the authors?
* Questions NGN (eNGiNe)
  * Need-to-know: Will affect conclusion (Major objection)
  * Good-to-know: Could affect conclusion (Other concern)
  * Nice-to-know: Won't affect conclusion (avoid asking this question)

## Pharmacometric Modeling Strategies

### Using PopPK Models for a New Indication

1. Start with an Existing Model: You have a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model for Drug X used in Indication A.
2. Gather New Data: New data is collected for Drug X in a different setting, Indication B.
3. Evaluate the Existing Model: Test the current PopPK model with the new data from Indication B without making any changes.
4. Assess Model Fit
  * If the model fits well: Use the existing model to estimate individual drug exposure.
  * If the model does not fit well: Update the PopPK model by combining the old data with the new data.
    * If the old data is unavailable, perhaps a prior can be used.
5. Re-evaluate the Updated Model
  * If the updated model fits the new data well: Use it to estimate individual drug exposure.
  * If it still doesn’t fit: Add more covariates, e.g. indication.
6. Refine the Model if Needed
  * If the updated model still doesn’t fit well: Consider improving the basic structure of the model to better capture the drug’s behavior.

By following these steps, you can effectively use an existing PopPK model for a new Indication setting, ensuring accurate estimates of drug exposure.

### Alternatives in PKPD modelling

* Assume a PK model
  * Estimate PK and PD parameters in a simultaneous fit (SIM)
  * Estimate PK parameters first and then fit PD
    * Condition on individual PK parameter estimates
      * Assume no error in parameters (IPP = Individual PK Parameters)
      * Account for error in parameters (IPPSE = Individual PK Parameters Standard Error) [@lacroixEvaluationIPPSEAlternative2012]
    * Fix population PK parameters
      * Include individual PK data (PPP&D = Population PK Parameters & Data)
      * Don’t include individual PK data (PPP = Population PK Parameters)

## Terminology

### Parsimony

The idea that comparing two models, the model with fewer parameters is preferrable, given that all else is equal.

### Shrinkage

A metric which quantifies how much individual estimates regress towards the population mean under the given sampling schedule [@savicImportanceShrinkageEmpirical2009].
