## Ordinal data

| Graphs | What does it assess? |
| :----- | :------------------- |
| **DV vs. PRED** | Trends may suggest a modification of **structural model**, **RUV model** or **IIV model**. |
| **CWRES vs (TIME, PRED)** | Trends may suggest a modification of **structural model**, **RUV model**, or **IIV model**. Trends by conditioning on covariates suggest including covariates. |
| **CWRES vs COV** | Trends suggest **including covariates** or changing the **covariate model**. |
