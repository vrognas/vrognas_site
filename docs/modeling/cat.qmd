### Logistic regression

Logistic regression is used to model binary data.
It is often used for eg E-R or dropout modeling.

E-R relationships of dichotomous endpoints based on logistic regression can be reliably assessed even in the presence of high shrinkage in the pharmacokinetic exposure metric [1,2].

# Which exposure metric should be used in E-R?

Ususally, just try all of them (e.g., C~avg~, C~trough~, C~max~), and choose the best one (lowest AIC).
They are most of the time highly correlated (>0.95), i.e., any of them can be used.
