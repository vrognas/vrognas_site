### Logistic regression

Logistic regression is used to model binary data.
It is often used for eg E-R or dropout modeling.

E-R relationships of dichotomous endpoints based on logistic regression can be reliably assessed even in the presence of high shrinkage in the pharmacokinetic exposure metric [1,2].

## Ordinal data

* Composite scores
  * IRT
