## Productivity/effectiveness Tips ’n’ tricks

* Take regular breaks.
    * Use a variant of the pomodoro-method eg work in units of 45min focused work followed by 15min break.
* Plan only ~75% of your working time to allow for unforeseen things.
* Plan, then do, then re-evaluate your plan
* Schedule important things, and force yourself to stick to the schedule

5 % Strategy  
15 % Position  
80 % Action  

> Better to be in the arena getting stomped by the bull, than it is to be up in the stands, or out in the parking lot.

## Getting things done


* Ppl have 100-200 next actions ar any one time
* Project: anything you are comited to finish within next few weeks/months that take more than one step to finish
* Most ppl have 30-100 projects
* Maintain vs Finish. Eg relationships, personal development

* Get your life back to widgets, but you have to define the widgets. ”Draft” instead of ”write” (crappy and still win)
* ”If you actually captured your thoughts the first time you had them, you’d be surprised how few you have”
* If you are not doing the weekly review, you are doing it all the time, but not really doing it. Finish the thinking!
* Winston Churchill: freedom from order. Discipline equals freedom.
