## General interpretation checklist

### Study Design & Population

* Is the **study design** informative (powered) enough for the intended analysis?
* Is the **study population** relevant for the intended inference?

### Data Selection & Management

* Are all relevant **data available** for the analysis?
* Are all data collected with the appropriate level of **exactness and completeness**?
* Are the data in the model independent (**low correlation**)?
* Are there available **data that were not included** in the analysis?
* How were the parameters included?
  * Based on a full model approach (FFEM) or **statistical significance** (e.g., SCM)?
* Are there **parameters that were omitted** from the analysis?
* Are there parts of the analysis that are **not shown**? Why?
* How were the values to visualize **chosen**?

### Data Integrity & Bias

* Are there potential biases introduced by **non-random patient dropouts**?
* Will the **model parameterization** impact the interpretation?
* Will the handling of **missing data** impact the interpretation?

### Statistical Clarity & Rationale

* How was the **uncertainty** assessed?
* Is the width of the confidence interval clear?
* How was the reference/baseline chosen and computed?
* Is there an objective rationale for the width of the reference area?

## Figures

Ideally, each figure should answer only **one question**.
You may have performed multiple independent experiments to answer one research question.
The results of these independent experiments can be combined into a multi-panel figure, with one overarching **declarative title**.

### Label line ends in time series with ggplot2^[https://drsimonj.svbtle.com/label-line-ends-in-time-series-with-ggplot2]

```r
library(tidyverse)

d <- Orange %>% 
  as_tibble()

d_ends <- d %>% 
  group_by(Tree) %>% 
  top_n(1, age) %>% 
  pull(circumference)

d %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, circumference, color = Tree)) +
    geom_line(size = 2, alpha = .8) +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~., breaks = d_ends)) +
    ggtitle("Orange trees getting bigger with age",
            subtitle = "Based on the Orange data set in R") +
    labs(x = "Days old", y = "Circumference (mm)")
```
