## Mathematics

### Updated mental models

Numbers arenâ€™t just a count; a better viewpoint is a *position on a line*.
This position can be negative ($-1$), between other numbers ($\sqrt{2}$), or in another dimension ($i$).

Arithmetic became a general way to transform a number.
Addition is sliding along the number line ($+ 3$ means slide 3 to the right) and multiplication is scaling ( $\times 3$ means scale it up 3 times).

Mathematically, the exponent function does this:

$$
\mathrm{original} \times \mathrm{growth}^{\mathrm{duration}} = \mathrm{new}
$$

or
$$
\mathrm{growth}^{\mathrm{duration}} = \frac{\mathrm{new}}{\mathrm{original}}
$$

| Operation | Old concept | New concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Addition | Repeated counting | Sliding |
| Multiplication | Repeated addition | Scaling |
| Exponents | Repeated multiplication | Growth for amount of time |

#### Understanding *e*

The number *e* is the base amount of growth shared by all continually growing processes.
The number *e* merges Rate and Time.
When we write:

$$
e^x
$$

The variable $x$ is a combination of rate and time.

$$
x = \text{rate} \times \text{time}
$$

So, our general formula becomes:

$$
\text{growth} = e^x = e^{r t}
$$

The number $e$ is about continuous growth.
Intuitively, $e^x$ means:

* How much growth do I get after after $x$ units of time (and 100% continuous growth)
