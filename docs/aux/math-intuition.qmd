## Understanding *e*

The number *e* is the base amount of growth shared by all continually growing processes.
The number *e* merges Rate and Time.
When we write:

$$
e^x
$$

the variable *x* is a combination of rate and time.

$$
x = \text{rate} \times \text{time}
$$

So, our general formula becomes:

$$
\text{growth} = e^x = e^{r t}
$$

The number *e* is about continuous growth.
Intuitively, $e^x$ means:

* How much growth do I get after after *x* units of time (and 100% continuous growth)
