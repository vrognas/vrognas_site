## Email

> Sorry I'm writing a long email, but I did not have time to write a short one

* Remove all notifications about new email.
  * You're not the President of the United States who needs to react to a nuclear threat. Emails/calls can always wait a few minutes.
* Agree on email response times e.g. one/two business days
* Never send emails outside office hours
  * Many modern email clinets now have a "Send Later" functionality. Use it.

### How to read email

* Read email in batches.
  * Schedule reading at least once per day, what works for you.
* Strive for "inbox zero"^[an empty inbox]---every day.
  * The inbox is for emails you have have decided what to do with yet.
* ~30sec to process every email
* If you open an email---make a decision.
  * Action required (takes ≤2 min^[or other amount that works for you])? **Do it now**
  * Action required (takes >2 min)? **Schedule it**
  * Action required (but waiting for something/someone)? **Set a reminder**
  * Action not required? **Archive**
    * Other emails go into the archive. Also all emails that required action go into the archive after action is taken.
    * I've found that just archiving all emails is more efficient than spending time to sort them into subfolder. When you want a certain email, just search for it.
* In general: Do not answer mails that you've been CC'ed on.

### How to write email

![](./images/email.jpg)

* Write your emails backwards
  * Write your receivers last.
* Keep email short, clear, and on topic.
  * Mind your language.
  * Aim for maximum 5 sentences.
  * [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) can help to make emails more coherent, consise, and to the point.
* Summarize message and action-points in the beginning of an email.
* New topic? New email.
* Make subject lines accurate
  * Action: 
  * Info:
  * Question:
  * Feedback: 
* CC can be viewed as ”For your information”
  * If you put someone in CC, you don't expect them to answer. It is either not actionable for them, or not directly related to them.
* Don't overuse CC. Everybody does not need to know everything.
* ”EOM” at end of subject line for short messages. Also FYI or AR (action required) at beginning of subject.
* (Almost) never use "Reply All".
  * Want fewer emails? Send fewer emails.

# CC & BCC

**CC = “carbon copy”.**
Back in the days before internet and email, in order to create a copy of the letter you were writing, you had to place carbon paper between the one you were writing on and the paper that was going to be your copy.

**BCC = “blind carbon copy.”**
It’s called blind carbon copy because the other recipients won’t be able to see that someone else has been sent a copy of the email.
While you can see a list of recipients when CC is used, that’s not the case with BCC.
No one ever sees the BCC list.
A BCC can reply to the sender, but other recipients can't send to BCC recipient with "reply all".

#### Do not use email for these situations

* When you require a quick answer (call them or go face-to-face instead)
* When you want to give negative feedback (go face-to-face instead)
* When you need to deliver bad news (go face-to-face instead)
* When you are angry/emotional (write a draft and send later instead)
