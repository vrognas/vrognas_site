### R

#### Naming

https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/second-hardest-cs-thing/

How good a name is can be assessed by how detailed the accompanying comment needs to be.

Good names:
* Precise (but not too long)
* Consistent
* Difficult to misinterpret
* Distinguishable
* Searchable (i.e. updateable)
* Pronounceable
* Honor conventions (e.g. *n* for count)

# Example of coding standards adopted in OSP organization

* Use all ALL_CAPS for constant variables (`public const double PI = 3.14;`)
* Prefix private/protected member variable with _ (`private int _currentDebt`)
* Use Pascal Casing for class names (`public class GlobalAccounting`)
* Use Pascal Casing for public and protected method name (`public void GetRevenues()`)
* Use Camel Casing for private method name (`private int balanceBooks()`)

```r
# not ideal - too imprecise
d

# okay - can use more precision
days

# good - middle ground
days_since_last_accident

# not ideal - unnecessarily precise
days_since_last_accident_floor_4_lab_23

...
```

:::{.callout-note}
Donâ€™t hesitate to choose lengthy names for **test** functions.

Unlike regular functions, long names are less problematic for test functions because

* they are not visible or accessible to the users
* they are not called repeatedly throughout the codebase
:::

Using generic names can improve code readability, but *only* if language or domain customs are followed.
However, even when you think you need generic names, you are better off using descriptive names.

* In type names, avoid using *class*, *data*, *object*, and *type* (e.g. bad: `classShape`, good: `Shape`)
* In function names, avoid using *be*, *do*, *perform*, etc. (e.g. bad: `doAddition()`, good: `add()`)
* But important details should be kept (e.g. okay: `child_height`, better: `child_height_cm`)

Boolean variable names should convey what true or false values represent.
In general, use positive terms for Booleans since they are easier to process.
But if the variable is only ever used in its false version (e.g. `is_volcano_inactive`), the negative version can be easier to work with.

#### Style

tidyverse style guide

### NONMEM

* Always MU-reference, in case EM-methods are needed.
  * Test all estimation methods.

#### Naming

Use descriptive variable names in snake_case or SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, not generic ones.
Try to make them as concise as possible.

```verilog
P = THETA(1) ; Don't do this
probability_no_event = THETA(1) ; Better
prob_no_event = THETA(1) ; Best
```

#### Style

Always spell out the control record in full, i.e., no abbreviations.

```verilog
$COVARIANCE ; Like this
$COV ; Not like this
```

Always use a newline before a control record.

Always use a newline after the following control records: `$PRED`, `$PK`, `$DES`, `$ERROR`.

```verilog
$PK

A = 1

$ERROR

Y = DV

```

Control records that can be written on a single line, or only consists of options (e.g. `$ESTIMATION`), does not need a newline after the control record.

```verilog
$PROBLEM dummy

$INPUT ID TIME DV EVID

$PK

A = 1

$ERROR

Y = DV

$ESTIMATION METHOD=1

$COVARIANCE MATRIX=R
```

Separate all math operators by spaces, except exponentials.

```verilog
A = 1 + 4 - 3 * 5 / 8**3
```
No space between function name and parentheses.

```verilog
LOG(A)
```

An IF-statement is not a function, so use a space (and indentation):

```verilog
IF (A > B) THEN
  1+1
ENDIF
```
