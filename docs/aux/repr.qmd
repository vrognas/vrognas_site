## Naming

* Name files/folders using only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -, _.
  * Start folder names with a number for sorting purposes.
* In general, use kebab-case for naming (easier to read than snake_case).
  * If there are multiple parts to a name (e.g., a description, a date, and an author), use snake_case to separate between parts, and kebab-case within the parts (e.g., `descriptive-name_2025-01-08_viktor-rognas.ext`)

## Coding

* Always MU-reference, in case EM-methods are needed.
  * Test all estimation methods.
* Script all plots.
* Quarto-scripted report.
  * `R.version`
  * `rstudioapi::versionInfo()`
  * `.packages()`
  * `devtools::session_info(pkgs = "attached")`

### Use version control (git or svn)

* Do not track model development in git, it is too messy, which messes with the git history.
  * Use `rsync` if needed
  * Track the Rmd-file for the report
  * This tracks the models. The models are still in the "messy" folder.
    * base_model <- run25.mod
    * covariate_model <- run63.mod
    * final_model <- run67.mod
    * simulation_model <- run68.mod
  * Runrecord
    * runno
    * based on
    * OFV
    * dOFV
    * Condition number (CN)
* Do not track produced PDFs in git
