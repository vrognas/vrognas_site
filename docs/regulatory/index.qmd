Regulatory documents are generally filled with walls of text, and much is up for interpretation.

This is why a clear yes/no answer from regulatory agencies are not possible until the final asssessment, when an assessment and interpretation of the totality of evidence has been made.

## Good Clinical Practice (GCP)

GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials involving human subjects' participation.
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that trial subjects' rights, safety, and well-being are protected, consistent with the principles in the **Declaration of Helsinki**, and that the clinical trial data are credible.

ICH E6 provides a unified global standard for ethics, data quality, and subject safety.
Other ICH guidelines relevant to the conduct of clinical trials are:

* E2A (clinical safety data management)
* E3 (clinical study reporting)
* E7 (geriatric populations)
* E8 (general considerations for clinical trials)
* E9 (statistical principles)
* E11 (pediatric populations)

| Principle from ICH E6 | Relevance to pharmacometrics |
| :-------- | :-------------- |
| 2.4 Adequate prior data | Dose‑setting PK modeling must rest on solid non‑clinical & early clinical results. |
| 2.5 Scientific soundness | Protocol must pre‑define sampling times, bioanalytical methods, population‑PK or NCA strategy. |
| 2.10 Accurate recording/storage | Raw concentration data ⇒ audit‑trails, ALCOA (Attributable‑Legible‑Contemporaneous‑Original‑Accurate). |
| 2.13 Quality systems | Risk‑based checks on data pipelines, LIMS, PK analysis scripts. |
