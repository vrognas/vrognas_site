## Introduction

NONMEM is a computer program.
The name stands for “NONlinear Mixed Effects Modeling.”

<https://www.iconplc.com/solutions/technologies/nonmem>

Some gotchas for NONMEM:

* Machine (double) precision: `MEPS = 1.0E-15`
* `INFTY = 1.0E+154`
* Largest possible integer = `2147483647`

## Running NONMEM

* NONMEM places the low bound equal to 1/100 (or 1/1000) of the initial value even if it is set to zero in the code. You may rerun with lower initial value or put `NOTHETABOUNDTEST` to the estimation record. (Credit: Leonid Gibiansky)

### Faster parallel NONMEM

`--threads-per-core=1`: Do not hyperthread.  
`FILE07–39` should be size 0; in fact, `FILE*` should be size 0.
Therefore, use `--maxlim=3`: Do not use diskspace (slow).  

```zsh
execute -nmfe_options="[sbatchargs=--threads-per-core=1] -maxlim=3  -parafprint=100"
```

### Interactive control of NONMEM runs

Find the directory where NONMEM is running (`NM_run1/` in PsN) and manually create an empty file with a different name according to the desired action.

```bash
touch file.sig
```

Here's a list:

| Action | Description | Filename |
|:-------|:------------|:---------|
| Print toggle | Monitor estimation progress | `print.sig` |
| Paraprint toggle | Monitor parallel processing traffic | `paraprint.sig` |
| Next | Move on to next estimation mode or next estimation. NONMEM grinds a couple of iterations more and then it terminates nicely as if the maximum number of function evaluations had been reached. | `next.sig` |
| Stop | End the present run cleanly | `stop.sig` |
| Subject print toggle | | `subject.sig` |
