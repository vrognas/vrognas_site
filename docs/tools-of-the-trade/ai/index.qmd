**Anthropic 4D framework for "AI Fluency":**

* **Delegation:** Deciding what work to do with AI vs. yourself
* **Description:** Communicating effectively (e.g., context/prompt engineering)
* **Discernment:** Evaluating AI output/behavior
* **Diligence:** Ensuring responsible AI interaction (accuracy, safety, security, accountability)

Application example: *You're using AI to help analyze a large dataset for a research paper.*

* **Delegation:** How would you divide the analytical work between yourself and the AI?
* **Description:** What context would the AI need to understand about your research question to do its share of the tasks well?
* **Discernment:** How would you verify the AI's analysis for accuracy?
* **Diligence:** What ethical considerations might arise when publishing AI-assisted research?

## Delegation

> The goal is to create the most effective human-AI partnership

1. **Problem Awareness:** Clearly define goals and the work needed, [**before**]{.red-underline} involving AI tools
2. **Platform Awareness:** Knowing through **hands-on** experience, what different AI systems can and can't do (capabilities and limitations).
3. **Task Delegation:** Strategically dividing work between you and AI
    1. **Automation:** AI executes specific tasks based on your instructions
    2. **Augmentation:** You and AI collaborate as creative thinking and task execution partners
    3. **Agency:** You configure AI to work independently on your behalf, establishing its knowledge and behavior patterns rather than just giving it specific tasks

What could be usefully automated?
Where would augmentation create more value than working separately?
What should be done by a human alone?
What could be done by an agent on your behalf?

>  "I'm preparing how to [insert task] and want to discuss with you what a delegation plan may look like for figuring out which parts I should delegate to an AI like you vs. not. Can you help me with this?"

## Description: Prompt Engineering

XML tags

```xml
<task>
1. Output an overview of every single dimension of my request.
2. Find points of uncertainty.
3. Ask as many clarifying questions as possible.
</task>

<request>

</request>

<context>

</context>
```

### Tips

* Start with brainstorming/planning, then move on to implementation
* Commit often with small, focused commits
* Always write a test so that the AI can iterate
* New problem, new chat. Clear the context; start fresh.
