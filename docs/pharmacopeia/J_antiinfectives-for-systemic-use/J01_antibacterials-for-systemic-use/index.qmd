Antibacterials (@fig-abx-classes) are drugs used to treat bacterial infections.
We often use the words *antimicrobials*, *antibacterials*, and *antibiotics* for these compounds.
They are similar terms, but each has a specific meaning:

* **Antimicrobials** target all kinds of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa.
* **Antibacterials** only act on bacteria. They include both antibiotics and some common disinfectants.
* **Antibiotics** are **naturally produced** by microorganisms and kill or inhibit other microorganisms, mainly bacteria.

The term "antibiotic" comes from the Greek words *anti* ("against") and *biotikos* ("concerning life").
Strictly speaking, antibiotics refers only to naturally produced substances, and not synthetic or semi-synthetic types (e.g., quinolones).
However, it is commonly used interchangeably with antibacterials.

## How do antibacterials work?

Antibacterials interfere with vital processes in bacterial cells.

* **Bactericidal** antibacterials kill bacteria.
* **Bacteriostatic** antibacterials prevent bacteria from multiplying.

The host's immune system then clears the remaining infecting pathogens.

### Antibiotic targets in bacteria

Different classes of antibacterials act on different parts of bacterial cells.
They mainly target:

1. The cell wall or membranes surrounding the cell.
2. The DNA and RNA production machinery.
3. The protein production machinery (ribosomes and related proteins).

These structures do not exist in human or animal cells, so antibacterials typically do not harm our cells.
However, side effects can still occur.


### Narrow-spectrum and broad-spectrum antibacterials

Some antibacterials have a **narrow** spectrum, meaning they act on only certain groups of bacteria.
Others are **broad** spectrum and affect many bacterial species.
Narrow-spectrum antibacterials are often preferred since they leave non-disease causing bacteria alone.
However, broad-spectrum antibacterials are sometimes used when doctors are unsure of the exact bacteria causing the infection.

## Resistance

Antibiotic resistance is a bacterias ability to survive the effects of an antibiotic.
In the presence of the antibiotic, resistant bacteria live and multiply.
Clinically, resistance means the bacterium can grow at drug exposures reached during standard treatment, leading to treatment failure.

Bacteria gain resistance through:

1. **Mutations** in their own DNA.
2. **Horizontal gene transfer**, where they acquire DNA from other bacteria.

If the new trait offers an advantage, the bacterium may pass it on to future generations or spread it through horizontal transfer.
Resistant bacteria travel through food, water, global trade, or human travel.

AMR terminology:

- **MDR**: Resistant to ≥1 agent in ≥3 classes  
- **XDR**: Resistant to ≥1 agent in all but 2 classes
- **PDR**: Resistant to all agents in all classes

### Resistance measurement: MIC

## Translating antibiotic PKPD

Preclinical antibiotic studies provide essential PKPD information to help select effective clinical dosing regimens.
There are two main approaches:

### Index-based approaches

The classical method links <span class="red-underline">**unbound**</span> antibiotic PK to the MIC.
Depending on the antimicrobial class, three relevant indices are traditionally described:

* ***f*AUC/MIC**: Exposure-dependent effect.
* ***f*C~max~/MIC**: Concentration-dependent effect.
* ***f*T~>MIC~**: Time above MIC. Time-dependent effect.

Decided by plotting log-kill against AUC, and fitting a non-linear (sigmoid) regression.
Highest R^2 decides the index.

:::{.callout-warning}
R^2 is used by convention, even though it's not suitable for non-linear regressions.
:::

These indices help set efficacy targets based on outcomes like bacterial stasis or log reductions in bacterial count.
Dose fractionation studies identify which index best predicts efficacy, and simulations then predict outcomes in diverse patient populations.
The Probability of Target Attainment (PTA) guides clinical dose selection and determines susceptibility breakpoints.

However, limitations of PK/PD indices include:

* Simplification using a single metric and MIC
* Ignoring bacterial dynamics (rate of killing, regrowth, resistance)
* Limited applicability to antibiotic combinations

### Model-based approaches

Model-informed Drug Development (MIDD) incorporates longitudinal data, capturing bacterial dynamics better than indices alone.
PKPD models developed from *in vitro* experiments predict *in vivo* outcomes and clinical efficacy.
Steps include:

1. Building initial models from *in vitro* data (static time-kill studies)
2. Refining models with dynamic *in vitro* and *in vivo* (mouse) studies
3. Integrating human PK data for simulations to predict clinical outcomes

This approach considers variability in bacterial dynamics across strains, doses, and patient populations.

### Impact of the immune system

The immune response significantly influences antibiotic efficacy.
Most antibiotic studies occur in neutropenic models, isolating antibiotic effects but overlooking immune interactions.
Immune variability among patients impacts real-world efficacy.
Incorporating immune response data into PKPD models may enhance the translation of preclinical findings to clinical practice, especially in patients with varying degrees of immunocompetence.
