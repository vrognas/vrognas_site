**Pharmacopœia**:  
*A collection of directions for the identification of medicines.*

This section presents a high-level overview of selected drug classes and their mechanisms of action.

## Drug modalities

In drug development, a modality (@tbl-modality) is the broad "type" or "format" of therapeutic intervention defined primarily by its molecular (or cellular) nature and the way it produces a clinical effect.

In practice: modality = "What kind of therapeutic thing is this?"

| Category | Modalities |
| :------- | :--------- |
| Conventional | Small molecules |
| Antibodies | Monoclonal antibody (mAb), Antibody–Drug Conjugate (ADC), Bi-specific antibody (BsAb) |
| Proteins and peptides | Recombinant |
| Cell therapies | Cell therapies, CAR-T, Stem cells, TCRT, CAR-NK, TILs |
| Gene therapies | Gene augmentation, Gene editing |
| Nucleic acids | DNA and RNA therapies, RNAi, mRNA |
| Other new modalities | Oncolytic viruses, Microbiomes, PROTAC |

ATMP (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product) is another term that is being used to describe a group of modalities.
In essence, ATMPs are a class of medicines that use living materials like cells, tissues, or genetic material to treat or prevent diseases. 

## ATC

Drugs are organized according to the [**Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)** classification system](https://atcddd.fhi.no/atc_ddd_index/).
The ATC system was developed in Norway and was introduced in 1976 and is maintained by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC).
It classifies active substances based on the organ or system they act on, as well as their therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties.

Drugs are classified in groups at five different levels.

* **ATC 1^st^ level:** Main anatomical or pharmacological group, shown in @tbl-atc-lvl-1 below.
* **ATC 2^nd^ level:** Pharmacological or Therapeutic subgroup
* **ATC 3^rd^ & 4^th^ levels:** Chemical, Pharmacological or Therapeutic subgroup
* **ATC 5^th^ level:** Chemical substance

| ATC level | Codes | Different names/pharmaceuticals |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Level 1 | 14 | 14 |
| Level 2 | 94 | 94 |
| Level 3 | 267 | 262 |
| Level 4 | 889 | 819 |
| Level 5 | 5067 | 4363 |

: ATC count per level {#tbl-atc-count}

The 2^nd^, 3^rd^ and 4^th^ levels are often used to identify pharmacological subgroups when that is considered more appropriate than therapeutic or chemical subgroups.

| ATC code | Contents |
| :------: | :------- |
| A | Alimentary tract and metabolism |
| B | Blood and blood forming organs |
| C | Cardiovascular system |
| D | Dermatologicals |
| G | Genito-urinary system and sex hormones |
| H | Systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins |
| J | Antiinfectives for systemic use |
| L | Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents |
| M | Musculo-skeletal system |
| N | Nervous system |
| P | Antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents |
| R | Respiratory system |
| S | Sensory organs |
| V | Various |

: Codes in the first ATC level, the *Anatomical main group* {#tbl-atc-lvl-1 tbl-colwidths="[10, 90]"}

## Example: metformin

The complete classification of metformin illustrates the structure of the code:

| Level                           | Code        | Description |
| :------------------------------ | :---------- | :---------- |
| **1:** Anatomical main group    | **A**       | Alimentary tract and metabolism |
| **2:** Therapeutic subgroup     | A**10**     | Drugs used in diabetes |
| **3:** Pharmacological subgroup | A10**B**    | Blood glucose lowering drues, excl. insulins |
| **4:** Chemical subgroup        | A10B**A**   | Biguanides |
| **5:** Chemical substance       | A10BA**02** | Metformin |

: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System {#tbl-mtf tbl-colwidths="[30, 10, 60]"}

Thus, in the ATC system all plain metformin preparations are given the code A10BA02.
For the chemical substance, the [International Nonproprietary Name (INN)](https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-and-policy-standards/inn) is preferred.
If INN names are not assigned, USAN (United States Adopted Name) or BAN (British Approved Name) names are usually chosen.
