Statins (or **HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors**) are a class of medications that reduce illness and mortality in people who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

Statins act by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase.
By inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, statins block the pathway for synthesizing cholesterol in the liver.
