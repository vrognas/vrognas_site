ðŸ‘‹ This site is where I collect what I learn about pharmacometrics, clinical pharmacology, and data science.
Explore the [EncyclopÃ¦dia](/docs/encyclopaedia/) for notes, models, and code.

**I believe in knowledge sharing.**
If you find something useful, don't keep it to yourself; share it with your colleagues! ðŸ’š
