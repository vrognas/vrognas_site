I am an aspiring scientist, pharmacometrician, and educator.
Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD project: providing a strategy to a reduce the number of subjects needed to support clinical efficacy of an antibiotic against resistant bacteria.
My goal with this blog is to document my life journey in general, and my PhD journey in particular.
